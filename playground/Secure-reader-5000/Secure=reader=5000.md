## Tools You'll Need

* A standard Phillips-head screwdriver.
* The provided USB Type-C to Type-A connection cable.
* Access to a power outlet near your setup station.

## Initial Setup & Verification

### Unbox and Inspect

Carefully remove the Secure Reader 5000 and all accessories from the packaging. Visually inspect the device for any signs of physical damage incurred during shipping.

### Establish Connection

Plug the USB-C end of the cable into the port on the rear of the reader. Connect the USB-A end to an available port on your host computer or terminal.

### Power On

Locate the power switch on the side of the unit and toggle it to the "ON" position. The green status LED should illuminate and begin a slow, steady blink, indicating the device is in standby mode and awaiting initialization.

### Verify Communication

On your host computer, open the Device Manager (Windows) or System Information (macOS). You should see the Secure Reader 5000 listed under "Ports (COM & LPT)" or as a new USB Serial Device. This confirms a successful basic hardware handshake.

## Troubleshooting

### No Power LED

Ensure the power switch is firmly in the "ON" position and that the USB cable is fully seated at both ends. Try a different USB port on your computer.

### Device Not Recognized

Try using the provided cable. Third-party cables may not support the full data/power profile required. If the issue persists, proceed to the advanced driver installation guide.
