## About Terminology

In this document, DynaProx products are referred to as the **device**. They are designed to be connected to a **host**, which is a piece of general-purpose electronic equipment which can send commands and data to, and receive data from, the device. Host types include PC and Mac computers/laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Generally, the host must have **software** installed that communicates with the device and is capable of processing transactions. During a transaction, the host and its software interact with the **operator**, such as a customer service representative, while the device interacts with the **cardholder** (even if the cardholder is using a virtual representation of the card account, such as a smartphone).

# Planning and Preparation

The guidelines in the following sections are intended to help project planners and system administrators plan for the physical and logical requirements of deploying and using DynaProx products. The most effective way to ensure smooth deployment of a solution is to consider these factors before receiving the device.

## Logistical Planning

-   Determine what type of **host** DynaProx will connect to. For a list of supported device types and operating systems, see **Table 3**. When planning, be sure to include any additional support or devices required by the host and DynaProx, such as physical locations, mounting, power connections, and charging cradles.
-   Determine what **connection** the host will use to communicate with the device. Depending on the device model (see **Table 3**), the connection can be USB or RS-232.
-   Determine what **software** will be installed on the host and how it will be configured. Software can include the operating system, transaction processing software, security software, and so on. If teams other than the software development team will be involved in preliminary device testing, MagTek recommends the solution development team provide a smoke test harness early in the development process to allow basic testing (for example, communication adapter testing). In addition, be sure to plan for any additional support required by the software, such as software licenses and network connections. Information about software is provided in section **4.2 About Host Software**.
-   Determine how the device will be physically presented to the cardholder. If the device is mounted, make sure there is adequate clearance for cardholders to swipe, insert, and tap. If the solution design includes metal objects anywhere near the device, including metal enclosures, make sure that at all points the metal is no further forward than 15mm below the face of the device. Proximity to metal can adversely affect the device’s performance.
-   Determine how the device should be configured and specify that configuration when ordering the device. A full list of configurable options is documented in **D998200489 DynaProx Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS)**.
-   Select and configure a secure workstation that advanced operators will use to configure and/or update the device. The workstation must be configured as follows:
    -   Available USB port.
    -   A secure means of obtaining files, either via the network (such as SFTP) or via removable media, such as USB flash drives. This is required for installing software tools, copying firmware files, etc. If you are using Magensa Services, make sure the secure workstation has an internet connection and has all the required Magensa Remote Services software components installed.

# Handling and Storage

| ![](<DynaProx Images/bdb6a105147891251b84fbdb350ba870.png>)                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proper handling of the device throughout delivery, assembly, shipping, installation, usage, and maintenance is very important. Not following the guidelines in this document could damage the device, render it inoperable, and/or violate the conditions of the warranty. |

## Handling to Avoid Damage

Upon receiving the device, inspect it to make sure it originated from an authentic source and has not been tampered with. For details, see **D998200502 DynaProx / DynaProx BCR Device Inspection**, available from MagTek.

From device delivery through assembly, shipping, installation, usage, and maintenance, the device must not be exposed to conditions outside the ratings in **Appendix A Technical Specifications**.

If the device is exposed to cold temperatures, adjust it to warmer temperatures gradually to avoid condensation, which can interfere with the operation of the device or cause permanent damage.

Do not drop or shake the device.

For information about ongoing maintenance of the device, such as cleaning, see section **7 Maintenance**.

## Handling to Avoid Accidental Tamper

DynaProx products implement active tamper detection, which uses a small amount of electricity even when the device is completely powered off. When unpowered by an external power supply, the device powers its active tamper detection circuitry using its non-rechargeable backup battery. This provides 5 years of backup shelf life across the entire life of the device. If the backup battery is allowed to completely discharge, the device’s tamper detection engages and locks down the device, and it must be returned to the manufacturer to reset.

To avoid accidental tamper events and to optimally condition the battery, follow these precautions:

-   Temperature is the most critical factor in extending battery life and preserving battery charge. Store the device at the lowest reasonable temperatures within its specified storage temperature range (see **Appendix A Technical Specifications**). Storing at temperatures between -30°C to 85°C (-22°F to 185°F) – DynaProx BCR -30°C to 70°C (-22°F to 158°F).
-   Do not drop or shake the device.
-   Do not attempt to disassemble the device.

# Installation

Installing DynaProx products is straightforward: The manufacturer or acquirer configures the preferred settings, keys, and terminal and payment brand settings before deployment; end users need only set up a host with appropriate software, configure the software, and connect the device to the host. This section provides general information about inspecting, connecting, and installing DynaProx products.

## About Inspection

Before unpacking the device, it is important to inspect its secure packaging to make sure it has not been tampered with in storage or in transit. MagTek provides details for inspecting the integrity of the device’s secure packaging in **D998200501 DynaProx / DynaProx BCR Package Inspection**.

It is important to thoroughly inspect a new device before deployment, and regularly inspect devices in live usage (including its immediate surroundings) to make sure malicious individuals have not tampered with it. MagTek recommends conducting inspection training for all device operators, and an inspection schedule with checkpoints in place to make sure operators are performing inspections as specified and as scheduled. MagTek provides an easy-to-follow device inspection reference **D998200502 DynaProx / DynaProx BCR Device Inspection**.

## About Host Software

In any solution, DynaProx products are connected to a host, which must have software installed that knows how to communicate with the device, and which is capable of processing transactions. To set up the host to work with DynaProx, follow the installation and configuration instructions provided by the vendor of the host or the host software. For information about developing custom host software, see section **8 Developing Custom Software**.

## Connecting to a Host

### About Connecting to a Host

The following sections provide steps for connecting DynaProx to a host via the various available physical connection types.

### How to Connect DynaProx to a Host via USB

![Diagram, engineering drawing Description automatically generated](<DynaProx Images/6bbbfa7091a552dfb28bfb82db885407.png>)

Figure 3 - Connecting to a USB Host

To connect DynaProx products to a USB host using the USB-C port, follow these steps (for reference see **Figure 3** and section **1.4 About DynaProx** Components):For best results, use the cable that is included with the device or another cable from **Table 4 - DynaProx Accessories** on page **8**. These cables are designed specifically for DynaProx products and include ferrite shielding at both ends of the cable to reduce emissions and interference. If the solution design requires an alternate cable, contact MagTek for assistance with ferrite selection and placement, and with connector over mold design.

Note: A poor quality cable, or cable longer than 12ft in length, can result in unexpected reader resets. Refer to **Table 4 - DynaProx Accessories** for cable options.

1.  Connect the USB-C end of the cable to DynaProx.
2.  Connect the other end of the USB cable to the host’s USB port.
3.  As soon as the device starts receiving power through USB, it automatically powers on.
4.  If the specific device serial number you are connecting has not been connected to the host before, Windows system tray on the host reports it is **Setting up a device**, see **Figure 4 – Device Setup**. When installation is complete (approximately 30 seconds later depending on the host), Windows reports **Device is ready**, (see **Figure 5 – Setup Complete)** and the device shows in Windows Device Manager under **Human Interface Devices** (**see Figure 6 – Windows Device Manager**) as two devices: **HID-compliant vendor-defined device** (see **Figure 7 – HID Compliant Vendor-defined Device Properties**) with VID **0801** and PID **2020**, and **USB Input Device**.

### How to Mount DynaProx

| ![](<DynaProx Images/bdb6a105147891251b84fbdb350ba870.png>)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| This document describes how to use DynaProx securely. Using the device in any way other than the approved methods described in this document invalidates the PCI PTS approval of the device.  Not following the guidelines in this section could damage the device, render it inoperable, and/or violate the conditions of the warranty. |

This section provides information and guidelines for designing the mechanical aspects of a solution that incorporates DynaProx products. MagTek strongly recommends vetting and testing solution designs before finalizing and deploying them, to make sure the design meets all requirements (e.g., functional, legal, security, certification, safety, and so on).

When designing the mechanical portions of a solution that incorporates DynaProx products, consider the following:

-   Review section **1.4 About DynaProx Components** for an overall introduction to the device’s physical features and what they are called.
-   Review **Appendix A Technical Specifications**.
-   Review the information below about overall device dimensions and mounting hole locations and use.
-   Review any additional requirements from other agencies, such as PCI and EMV solution certification requirements, safety ordinances, and so on, which may introduce additional constraints to the design.

Overall dimensions of the device are shown in **Figure 9**. On request, MagTek can provide a 3D model of the device’s envelope to assist with the mechanical portion of solution design. MagTek strongly recommends building and testing prototypes with actual devices before finalizing the solution design.

**![Diagram Description automatically generated](<DynaProx Images/cdb8440344fec202f20ab08893de7040.png>)**

Figure 9 - DynaProx Overall Dimensions

The screw hole placement on the bottom of DynaProx products is detailed in **Figure 10**. The holes are designed to accommodate screw size **M4 x 0.7mm** and a maximum screw depth of 0.315 inches (8mm) into the device. The recommended torque range for installing the screws is 20 to 22 in-lbs. (2.3 to 2.5 N-m).

When mounting DynaProx, make sure gasket is seated properly to ensure IP65 rating, see **Figure 11**.

The suggested panel cutouts for the USB and RS-232 connectors are shown in **Figure 12** with a DynaProx shown for reference. The dimensions for the suggested panel cutouts are shown in **Figure 13**.

Figure 13 – DynaProx Suggested USB and RS-232 Panel Cutout Dimensions

When designing the enclosure or mounting bracket, make sure there is adequate clearance for cardholders to tap or users to present a bar code. If the solution design includes mounting to metal surfaces, there will typically not be any impact to performance or card reading range. If the design of the enclosure includes mounting the DynaProx such that the top surface is flush with adjacent metal on the same plane, the range of the contactless reader may be reduced. By keeping the card reading plane a few millimeters above any adjacent metal surfaces or providing a few millimeters of gap between the reader and adjacent metal will assure acceptable card reading performance. Proximity to metal can reduce the device’s reading range.

### How to Mount the Stand

Figure 17a - Recommended Disassembly Procedure

**Disassembly**

Repeat assembly in reverse order to remove device from counter installation and stand. See **Figure 17a - Recommended Disassembly Procedure.**

# Configuration

The device does not have an on-screen configuration interface. However, it does have settings the host can change using commands. These settings are documented as **Properties** in **D998200489 DynaProx Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS)**.

# Operation

## About Operating Modes

During operation, DynaProx devices transition between distinct operating modes, which are important for operators to understand so they can properly control the device:

-   **Powered Off Mode** is the shipping and storage mode of the device. No external power is applied to the device through the USB cable or RS-232 cable. In this mode, the device consumes practically no power. To set the device from Powered Off mode to Active mode, connect the device to USB power or RS-232 power.
-   **Active Mode** is the device’s normal “awake” state when it is in use. In this mode, LEDs are powered on, and the device is ready to receive commands from the host. To set the device from Active mode to Powered Off mode remove power.

## Operation Overview

During normal operation, the operator initiates a transaction from the host, and the cardholder interacts with the device. Transaction types may include new accounts, teller window applications, checking, savings, mortgages, retail transactions, or any other type of transaction where there is interaction between the cardholder and the operator.

For each transaction type, the host software directs the cardholder, and the transaction flow on the device may differ depending on what the host software specifies and what the cardholder does. Section **6.6.3 About Maintenance** Reset

For full host control, the device should not be allowed to run for \> = 23 hours without a reset. To accomplish this, have the host application send a reset command twice a day separated by at least one hour.

Example: Host software resets the device at 1 AM and 3AM. This keeps the device from initiating its own reset.

Card Reading provides examples of the cardholder experience for each type of payment. If the device cannot read payment data, the host software may prompt the cardholder to repeat the action or reject the transaction.

## Introduction to User Interface

As mentioned in section **1.4 About DynaProx Components**, DynaProx models equipped with a barcode reader (BCR) have a similar physical appearance as models without a BCR, as shown in **Figure 18**. BCR models are equipped with a camera and a QR code located on the front side of the device.

-   DynaProx devices have a user interface composed of two elements: a visual indicator consisting of four mono LEDs and a beeper that produces audible alerts.
-   DynaProx BCR devices have a user interface composed of three elements: a visual indicator consisting of four mono LEDs, a barcode reader, and a beeper that produces audible alerts.
-   DynaProx devices do not feature any input components such as buttons or touch screens.

**Figure 18 – DynaProx and DynaProx BCR**

### Component Details

1.  LED Ordering

The arrangement of the four mono LEDs on DynaProx and DynaProx BCR devices is illustrated in **Figure 19**. The LEDs are labeled LEDs 1 to 4 and are ordered from left to right on the device.

![A picture containing appliance, kitchen appliance, sketch, drawing Description automatically generated](<DynaProx Images/52a3c07f563158b8c598ff645de96d9e.jpg>)![A close-up of a machine Description automatically generated with low confidence](<DynaProx Images/e0be4a9d2e8e51b93c9c9e40d447fd91.jpg>)

**Figure 19 - LED Ordering**

2.  LED Status

    When DynaProx is powered on, its LEDs will illuminate green, when it is powered off, the LEDs will remain unlit. **Figure 20** illustrates the on/off status of the LEDs.

**Figure 20 - LED ON/OFF**

3.  BCR Status

    DynaProx devices equipped with a bar code reader have a status light that indicates whether the barcode feature is powered on or off.

    ![](<DynaProx Images/c52f721c4c181bad825cdde0a6ad71f4.png>)![A close-up of a machine Description automatically generated with low confidence](<DynaProx Images/e0be4a9d2e8e51b93c9c9e40d447fd91.jpg>)

**Figure 21 - BCR Light**

4.  Beeper Alert

All DynaProx devices are equipped with a beeper that produces a short beep lasting for half a second and a long beep that lasts for one second.

### Modes of Operation

This section contains information regarding the operational modes of DynaProx's LEDs, beeper, and BCR light. It is important to note that DynaProx devices are not equipped with batteries. If there is no power supply to the device through the USB cable or RS-232 serial port, all LEDs, along with the BCR light, will not illuminate. In such instances, the user interface will resemble the device as it appears in **Figure 18**.

#### Power On via USB Cable

When the device USB cable is connected to the host USB port, a brief beep will sound and all four LEDs will turn on for half a second, as shown in **Figure 22**. Following this, LED 1 and LED 2 will remain illuminated, while LED 3 and LED 4 will remain unlit. After a duration of 10 seconds, all LEDs will turn off, and the device will enter an idle state. This occurs because the host sets the USB port into suspension mode, prompting the device to enter an idle state.

### Event Notification Mode

When the device is configured in Event Notification Mode, the user interface will have the same appearance as depicted in **6.3.2.3** **Payment Transaction**.

### Bar Code Read Only

At present, no user interface elements such as LEDs or beeper sounds have been established for DynaProx.

## About the Status LEDs

DynaProx provides four Mono LEDs (see section **1.4 About DynaProx** Components), numbered LED1 through LED4, which report the device’s current operating status.

-   The meaning of each LED depends on the device’s operating mode. See section **6.1 About Operating Modes** and Error! Reference source not found. Error! Reference source not found.. Most of the time, operators will check the device’s status using the LEDs when it is in **Active Mode** while the device is not performing a transaction.
-   LED blinking patterns have specific meanings as well, as described in **Table 5**. A blinking LED generally means the device is actively doing something to change the state that the LED is indicating, and solid indicates a persistent state that would require an operator or cardholder to take action to change. One major exception is a device-wide functional failure state, such as a tamper state, where all LEDs flash urgently to call the attention of an advanced operator to intervene.

In this manual, specific blinking patterns are described in more detail in the sections where they are relevant. For example, information about how the LEDs show the device’s connection status is in section **4.3 Connecting to a Host**.

## About Sounds

DynaProx products have a beeper that provides feedback to operators and cardholders about the internal state of the device:

-   The device sounds one short beep after it has successfully read a contactless tap, and the cardholder can safely remove the card or device from the contactless landing zone.
-   The device emits two beeps when reading a card or contactless payment device to indicate a card read error occurred.
-   The device sounds two beeps when an operator cancels a pending EMV transaction.

The device provides an internal setting the host can use to adjust the global system volume. The device does not provide an interface to change the volume setting directly via buttons. If the device is too quiet or too loud:

-   Make sure the device is being ordered from the manufacturer with the desired volume setting.
-   Check to see whether the host software you are using provides a feature to check and/or adjust the volume setting.
-   If the host software does not provide that feature, request help from the development team that built the host software to check / change the volume setting. For details, see **D998200489 DynaProx Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS)**.

### How to Play a Sequence of Tones

To play a sequence of tones, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure the device is in idle state.
2.  Send an audio command to the device for playing a sequence of tones. For details, see **D998200489 DynaProx Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS)**.

## Power Management

### About Power

When properly powered through its USB port or RS-232 port, the device powers on automatically. For USB mode it will remain full powered mode to provide power to device. This device does not support USB suspend mode.

The minimum required current and voltage are very important to the proper operation of the DynaProx reader. During contactless card reading, the NFC field is activated and the required current will rise from less than 100 mA to less than 800 mA for typically around 1 second. If the momentary current draw causes the supplied voltage to drop below 4 VDC, the DynaProx reader may reset and fail to complete the card read.

Embedded systems and Single Board Computers (SBC) may find use in a wide range of card tending terminals. If the DynaProx will be supplied power through a USB port from one of these SBCs, it is important to be aware of the USB port current limitations, such as all USB ports may share a given amount of current, or the upstream current limitation of the system power supply.

An optional power/ground connection is available on the DynaProx RS-232 connector, even if the actual RS-232 signals are not in use.

### How to Power On / Wake Up from Standby Mode / Power Off

To power on the device connect the device to USB power or RS-232 Power. Recommended 800 mA available current during transactions.

To power off the device, disconnect the device from USB power or RS-232 Power.

If all LEDs are off, the device is in Powered Off mode.

### About Maintenance Reset

For full host control, the device should not be allowed to run for \> = 23 hours without a reset. To accomplish this, have the host application send a reset command twice a day separated by at least one hour.

Example: Host software resets the device at 1 AM and 3AM. This keeps the device from initiating its own reset.

## Card Reading

### About Reading Cards

The steps for starting a transaction and reading a contactless payment device are different depending on the device’s configuration and on the design of the host software. Host software developers should see section **8 Developing Custom Software** for implementation references. The solution developer should provide solution-specific instructions for operators to follow. A transaction generally follows this essential flow:

1.  An advanced operator has already made sure DynaProx is configured properly and is connected to the host (see section **4.3 Connecting to a Host**). When the device is connected to the host via USB and powered by the USBC connector or RS-232, the host software may always keep a connection open to the device.
2.  The operator makes sure DynaProx is receiving power either from the USB connection or from the RS-232 connection, and is awake and powered on (see section **6.6.2 How to Power On / Wake Up** from Standby Mode / Power Off and section **6.4 About the Status LEDs**).
3.  The operator uses the host software’s user interface (for example, a point of sale) to finalize a transaction amount, then initiates a transaction. In solutions that are designed to respond to cardholder input events that occur when the device is idle, such as unprompted tapping of a card or electronic payment device, the host software may respond to those inputs by notifying the host, and the host software may trigger other operations without being initiated by an operator (for example, the host software may immediately start a transaction, or alert the cardholder or operator to take action).
4.  The host communicates with the device, and reports to the operator when the device is ready.
5.  The operator guides and assists the cardholder in presenting payment.
6.  The cardholder interacts with the device to present payment. The following sections provide additional details about presenting each of the available payment methods.
7.  The host monitors the progress of the transaction, and when necessary, should report issues to the operator, who may need to relay the messages to the cardholder.
8.  The device reports the success or failure of the transaction to the cardholder and to the host.

### How to Tap Contactless Cards / Devices

To tap a contactless card or smartphone, follow these steps:

1.  Check LED status:
    1.  The device shows the transaction status using the LEDs. LED1 lights solid and all other LEDs are off, per EMV standards, to indicate it is ready for a tap.
    2.  All devices report detailed transaction status to the host, and host software may report that information to operators so they can guide cardholders through the transaction (for example, “please tap your card now”).
2.  If the cardholder is using an electronic payment device, such as a smartphone, make sure the payment device has **NFC** turned **On** and has a payment app configured to process transactions. For details, see the documentation provided by the smartphone manufacturer and payment app publisher.
3.  Briefly hold the card, smartphone, or other contactless payment device over the contactless landing zone, indicated by the EMVCo Contactless Indicator symbol on the device’s face (see **Figure 36**). Because each smartphone model may have its NFC antenna placed differently, the ideal tap position may vary by make and model. For example, Samsung users may need to center the phone on the contactless landing zone, while Apple users may need to tap the top of the phone on the contactless landing zone.
4.  Wait for LED status:
    1.  The device quickly lights the second LED to show it is processing, then lights the third LED to show it has successfully read the tap, then lights the fourth LED to show the read is complete (see **Figure 37**).
    2.  The device beeps once.
    3.  If the transaction requires a signature, the device sends a notification message to the host that includes the status **Signature Capture Requested**. In this case, the solution design collects the cardholder’s signature via a different method.
    4.  The device ends the transaction and reports the transaction status to the host.
5.  If the device cannot communicate with the card, smartphone, or other contactless payment device:
    1.  The device ends the transaction.
    2.  The device lights LED4 for a short time.
    3.  The device beeps twice.
    4.  The device notifies the host that the transaction failed. If this occurs, the host software may choose to retry the transaction or revert to prompting the operator to perform another operation that is specific to the solution design.

### How to Scan Barcodes

To scan a barcode, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure you are using a DynaProx model that includes a barcode reader, indicated by QR code markings on the face of the device surrounding the barcode reader lens (see section **1.4 About DynaProx Components**).
2.  If the barcode being scanned is not on a self-illuminated source such as a smartphone, make sure there is enough ambient light for the camera to read the barcode. In low light conditions, the barcode reader will only be able to read self-illuminated sources.
3.  In some solutions, the operator may have to perform an operation in the host software to enable the barcode reader, or to start a transaction with the barcode reader enabled.
4.  Wait for the device, the host, or the operator to prompt for a barcode read:
    1.  The device lights the barcode reader indicator LED next to the barcode reader lens.
5.  Hold the barcode in front of the barcode reader camera:
    1.  If possible, use the light from the barcode reader indicator LED to align the barcode within the barcode reader’s field of view, which extends 16 degrees above / below and 21 degrees to the left / right of a line perpendicular to the barcode reader lens.
    2.  Hold the barcode as close as 1 inch from the lens. For smaller barcodes, the device will read immediately. If it does not, gradually move away up to 14 inches from the lens until the device reports a successful read. Larger barcodes must be far enough away from the device that the whole barcode is within the camera’s field of view; if a large barcode is too close, the barcode reader can only see a zoomed in portion of the barcode.
    3.  Do not tilt the barcode more than 60 degrees from parallel to the device’s face.
6.  Wait for the device or the host to report the barcode has been read successfully:
    1.  The device beeps once.
    2.  The device turns off the barcode reader indicator LED.

### Apple VAS for DynaProx

DynaProx products support Apple Value Added Services (Apple VAS) protocol.

Contactless transactions using the Apple VAS protocol permits the device reader to perform the following supported operations:

#### VAS App and Payment Mode (Dual Mode)

The device reads both Apple VAS data and EMV payment data from a tapped smartphone or reads EMV payment data from a tapped card. When device sends ARQC to the host to conclude the transaction, it includes EMV payment data in container FC and includes VAS data, if available, in container FE

#### VAS App Only Mode (VAS Mode)

The device reads only Apple VAS data from a tapped smartphone and does not read data from a tapped card. If the tapped smartphone does not support VAS, the device does not detect or read from the smartphone. When the device send ARQC to conclude the transaction, it includes VAS data in container FE and does not include EMV payment data in container FC.

#### VAS App or Payment Mode (Single Mode)

The device reads only Apple VAS data from a tapped smartphone or reads EMV payment data from a tapped card. When the device sends ARQC to conclude the transaction, it only includes either EMV payment data in container FC for cards, or includes VAS data in container for smartphones.

#### Payment Only Mode (Payment Mode)

The device operates the same as EMV mode (01). It reads only EMV payment data from a tapped smartphone or a tapped card. When the device sends ARQC to conclude the transaction, it includes EMV payment data in container FC and does not include VAS data in container FE.

For details, see **D998200489 DynaProx Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS).**

### How to Tap Contactless NFC Tags / MIFARE Classic / MIFARE DESFire /MIFARE Plus Cards and Send Pass-through Commands

DynaProx is compatible with near field communication (NFC) technology such as MIFARE Classic / MIFARE DESFire /MIFARE Plus contactless IC products (smart cards).

To tap an NFC Contactless IC Product and Send Pass-through commands, follow these steps:

1.  Check LED status:
    1.  Per EMV standards, the device indicates transaction status through its LED indicators, located on the front face of the device. When ready for a tap, LED 1 shines steadily while all other LEDs remain unlit.
    2.  All devices communicate transaction details to the host. The host software will relay this information to operators, allowing them to direct cardholders during the transaction, such as prompting "please tap your card now".
2.  Place the card over the device's designated contactless landing zone, marked by the EMVCo Contactless Indicator symbol on the front face of the device.
3.  Wait for LED status:
    1.  Initially, LED 2 illuminates, signaling the device is processing. The device subsequently illuminates LED 3 and LED 4, indicating card detection. Notifications are then sent to identify the card type and UID.
    2.  The Host application can further interact with the NFC Tag using pass-through commands. For details, see **D998200489 DynaProx Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS).**
    3.  If the pass-through command is the last successful command, the device will end the transaction, emitting a single beep signaling a successful transaction. The user then needs to remove the card.
    4.  If an error is detected, the device will end the transaction and emit two beeps to signal the error. The user then needs to remove the card.
4.  The device notifies the host that the transaction has ended with the NFC Tag removed.

| **Never do any of the following:** DO NOT use a ground adapter plug to connect equipment to a power socket-outlet that lacks a ground connection terminal. DO NOT attempt any maintenance function that is not specifically described in this manual or in other ExpressCard 3000 instructional documents published by MagTek. DO NOT remove any of the covers or guards that are fastened with screws. There are no user-serviceable areas within these covers. DO NOT override or “cheat” electrical or mechanical interlock devices. DO NOT use EC3000 supplies or cleaning materials for other than their intended purposes. DO NOT operate the equipment if you or anyone else have noticed unusual noises or odors.  **Consider the following before operating the ExpressCard 3000:** Connect the EC3000 to a properly grounded AC power socket-outlet. If in doubt, have the socket-outlet checked by a qualified electrician. Improper connection of the device’s grounding conductor creates a risk of electric shock. Place the EC3000 on a solid surface that can safely support the device’s weight plus the weight of a person leaning against it (such as a service technician). Be careful when moving or relocating the device. Use proper lifting techniques. Use materials and supplies specifically designed for MagTek devices. Using unsuitable materials may result in poor performance, and in some cases may be hazardous. |
