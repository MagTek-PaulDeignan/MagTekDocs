## About Terminology

In this document, DynaFlex II Go products are referred to as the **device**. They are designed to be connected to a **host**, which is a piece of general-purpose electronic equipment that can send commands and data to, and receive data from, the device. Host types include PC and Mac computers/laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Generally, the host must have **software** installed that communicates with the device and is capable of processing transactions. During a transaction, the host and its software interact with the **operator**, such as a customer service representative, while the device interacts with the **cardholder** (even if the cardholder is using a virtual representation of the card account, such as a smartphone).

# Planning and Preparation

The guidelines in the following sections are intended to help project planners and system administrators plan for the physical and logical requirements of deploying and using DynaFlex II Go products. The most effective way to ensure smooth deployment of a solution is to consider these factors before receiving the device.

## Logistical Planning

-   Determine what type of **host** DynaFlex II Go will connect to. For a list of supported device types and operating systems, see **Table 2**. When planning, be sure to include any additional support or devices required by the host and DynaFlex II Go, such as physical locations, mounting, power connections, and charging cradles.
-   Determine what **connection** the host will use to communicate with the device. The available connections are USB-C for power and control and Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE) for wireless connectivity (see **Table 2**).
-   Determine what **software** will be installed on the host and how it will be configured. Software can include the operating system, transaction processing software, security software, and so on. If teams other than the software development team will be involved in preliminary device testing, MagTek recommends the solution development team provide a smoke test harness early in the development process to allow basic testing (for example, communication adapter testing). In addition, be sure to plan for any additional support required by the software, such as software licenses and network connections. Information about software is provided in section **4.2 About Host Software**.
-   Determine how the device will be physically presented to the cardholder. If the device is mounted, make sure there is adequate clearance for cardholders to swipe, insert, and tap. If the solution design includes metal objects anywhere near the device, including metal enclosures, make sure that at all points the metal is no closer than 15mm from the MSR swipe path or card insertion slot. Proximity to metal can adversely affect the device’s performance.
-   Determine how the device should be configured and specify that configuration when ordering the device. A full list of configurable options is documented in **D998200597 DynaFlex II Go Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS)**.
-   Select and configure a secure workstation that advanced operators will use to configure and/or update the device. The workstation must be configured as follows:
    -   Available USB port.
    -   A secure means of obtaining files, either via the network (such as SFTP) or via removable media, such as USB flash drives. This is required for installing software tools, copying firmware files, etc. If you are using Magensa Services, make sure the secure workstation has an internet connection and has all the required Magensa Remote Services software components installed.
    -   **1000007406 DynaFlex, DynaProx Test Utility** installed, which advanced operators can use to configure and test the device.
-   Determine the final set of tools advanced operators will use to configure, test, and update the device. This documentation uses the **1000007406 DynaFlex, DynaProx Test Utility** as an example for configuring the device; it can be used for initial pre-deployment testing and development, and as sample code showing how to communicate with the device, but the full solution may call for customized, solution-specific software for configuring the device and updating firmware.
-   Determine how to **inspect** devices upon arrival, upon installation, and periodically during live usage, to ensure malicious individuals have not tampered with them. Details about inspection are provided in section **4.1 About Inspection**.
-   Develop procedures for maintaining the device(s). Detailed guidance is provided in section **8 Maintenance**.
-   Determine how to train operators. For example, training may include information extracted from section **5 Configuration**, section **6 Operation**, and section **8 Maintenance**.
-   Review the device’s PCI Security Policy, posted to the PCI web site [www.pcisecuritystandards.org](http://www.pcisecuritystandards.org) under **Approved PIN Transaction Security (PTS) Devices**, for additional information about using the device securely.

# Handling and Storage

| ![](<DynaFlex II Go Images/bdb6a105147891251b84fbdb350ba870.png>)                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proper handling of the device throughout delivery, assembly, shipping, installation, usage, and maintenance is very important. Not following the guidelines in this document could damage the device, render it inoperable, and/or violate the conditions of the warranty. |

## Handling to Avoid Damage

Upon receiving the device, inspect it to make sure it originated from an authentic source and has not been tampered with. For details, see **D998200593 DynaFlex II Go Device Inspection Document**, available from MagTek.

From device delivery through assembly, shipping, installation, usage, and maintenance, the device must not be exposed to conditions outside the ratings in **Appendix A Technical Specifications**.

If the device is exposed to cold temperatures, adjust it to warmer temperatures gradually to avoid condensation, which can interfere with the operation of the device or cause permanent damage.

Do not drop or shake the device.

For information about ongoing maintenance of the device, such as cleaning, see section **8 Maintenance**.

## Handling to Avoid Accidental Tamper

DynaFlex II Go products implement active tamper detection, which uses a small amount of electricity even when the device is completely powered off. When unpowered by an external power supply, the device powers its active tamper detection circuitry using its non-rechargeable internal backup battery. This provides 5 years of backup shelf life across the entire life of the device. If the backup battery is allowed to completely discharge, the device’s tamper detection engages and locks down the device, and it must be returned to the manufacturer to reset.

To avoid accidental tamper events and to optimally condition the battery, follow these precautions:

-   Temperature is the most critical factor in extending battery life and preserving battery charge. Store the device at the lowest reasonable temperatures within its specified storage temperature range (see **Appendix A Technical Specifications**). Storing at temperatures between -4°F to 113°F (-20°C to 45°C).
-   Do not drop or shake the device.
-   Do not attempt to disassemble the device.

# Installation

Installing DynaFlex II Go products is straightforward: The manufacturer or acquirer, configures the preferred settings, keys, terminal, and payment brand settings before deployment; end users need only set up a host with appropriate software, configure the software, and connect the device to the host. This section provides general information about inspecting, connecting, and installing DynaFlex II Go products.

## About Inspection

Before unpacking the device, it is important to inspect its secure packaging to make sure it has not been tampered with in storage or in transit. MagTek provides details for inspecting the integrity of the device’s secure packaging in **D998200594 DynaFlex II Go Package Inspection Document**.

It is important to thoroughly inspect a new device before deployment, and regularly inspect devices in live usage (including its immediate surroundings) to make sure malicious individuals have not tampered with it. MagTek recommends conducting inspection training for all device operators, and an inspection schedule with checkpoints in place to make sure operators are performing inspections as specified and as scheduled. MagTek provides an easy-to-follow device inspection reference **D998200593 DynaFlex II Go Device Inspection Document**.

## About Host Software

DynaFlex II Go products do not have a display. In any solution, DynaFlex II Go must be connected to a host, which must have software installed that can communicate with the device and is capable of processing transactions. To set up the host to work with DynaFlex II Go, follow the installation and configuration instructions provided by the vendor of the host or the host software. For information about developing custom host software, see section **9 Developing Custom Software**.

| This document describes how to use DynaFlex II Go securely. Using the device in any way other than the approved methods described in this document invalidates the PCI PTS approval of the device. Not following the guidelines in this section could damage the device, render it inoperable, and/or violate the conditions of the warranty. |

This section provides information and guidelines for designing the mechanical aspects of a solution that incorporates DynaFlex II Go products. MagTek strongly recommends vetting and testing solution designs before finalizing and deploying them, to make sure the design meets all requirements (e.g., functional, legal, security, certification, safety, and so on).

When designing the mechanical portions of a solution that incorporates DynaFlex II Go products, consider the following:

-   Review section **1.1 Key Features and Components** for an overall introduction to the device’s physical features and what they are called.
-   Review **Appendix A Technical Specifications**.
-   Review the information below about overall device dimensions and mounting hole locations and use.
-   Review any additional requirements from other agencies, such as PCI and EMV solution certification requirements, safety ordinances, and so on, which may introduce additional constraints to the design.

Overall dimensions of the device are shown in **Figure 6**. On request, MagTek can provide a 3D model of the device’s envelope to assist with the mechanical portion of solution design. MagTek strongly recommends building and testing prototypes with actual devices before finalizing the solution design.

Figure 6 - DynaFlex II Go Overall Dimensions

When designing an enclosure or mounting bracket, make sure there is adequate clearance for cardholders to tap or users to present a bar code. Proximity to metal can reduce the device’s reading range.

# Configuration

The device does not have an on-screen configuration interface. However, it does have settings the host can change using commands. These settings are documented as **Properties** in **D998200597 DynaFlex II Go Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS)**.

# Operation

## Operation Overview

The operator initiates a transaction from the host, and the cardholder interacts with the device. Transaction types may include retail transactions, new accounts, teller window applications, checking, savings, mortgages, and any other type of transaction where there is interaction between the cardholder and the operator.

For each transaction type, the host software directs the cardholder. The transaction flow on the device may differ depending on what the host software specifies and what the cardholder does. Section **7.9 Card Reading** provides examples of the cardholder experience for each type of payment. If the device cannot read payment data, the host software may require the cardholder to repeat the action or require the host to reject the transaction.

## Physical Button Operation

All DynaFlex II Go devices have a single physical button, see **Figure 61 - Power Button**. Pressing and holding this button can activate extra functions. To active a specific function, press and hold the button until a specific number of beeps are heard. **Table 61 - Button Functions** contains functions that can be activated. Beep counts that are not listed are not supported.

## About Operating Modes

During operation, DynaFlex II Go devices transition between distinct operating modes, which are important for operators to understand:

-   **Powered Off Mode** is the shipping and storage mode of the device. No external power is applied to the device through the USB cable or from the internal rechargeable battery. In this mode, the device consumes very little power. To set the device from **Powered Off** mode to **Active Mode**, connect the device to USB power, or press the power button, see **Figure 61 - Power Button** .
-   **Active Mode** is the device’s normal “awake” state when it is in use. In this mode, the device LED indicators are powered on, and the device is ready to receive commands from the host. For more information on Status LEDs and LED behavior see sections **7.4 About the Status LEDs**, **7.5** Bluetooth**® Low Energy** (LE) LED Behavior, **7.5.7 DynaFlex II Go Bluetooth®** Low Energy (LE) Sleep Mode

When in Bluetooth® LE Sleep Mode, DynaFlex II Go will conserve battery life by limiting power to non-essential hardware features and entering low power mode. When in Sleep Mode, the device will appear to be powered off, with no LEDs illuminated, see **Figure 7 – Bluetooth® (LE) Sleep Mode**. For information on how to disable this feature, see **D998200597 DynaFlex II Go Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS).**

-   LED Behavior: Successful Transactions, and **7.7 LED Behavior: Errors, Timeouts, and Canceled Transactions**. To set the device from Active mode to Powered Off mode remove power press and hold the power button for two beeps.
-   **BLE Sleep Mode** is a standard feature that conserves battery life by limiting power to non-essential hardware features. When in Sleep Mode, the device will appear to be powered off, with no LEDs illuminated, see **7.5.7 DynaFlex II Go Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE) Sleep Mode,** for more information on BLE Sleep Mode.

## About Sounds

DynaFlex II Go products have a beeper that provides feedback to operators and cardholders about the internal state of the device:

-   The device sounds one short beep after it has successfully read a contactless tap, and the cardholder can safely remove the card or device from the contactless landing zone.
-   The device emits two beeps when reading a card or contactless payment device to indicate a card read error occurred.
-   The device sounds two beeps when an operator cancels a pending EMV transaction.

The device provides an internal setting the host can use to adjust the global system volume. The device does not provide an interface to change the volume setting directly via buttons. If the device is too quiet or too loud:

-   Make sure the device is being ordered from the manufacturer with the desired volume setting.
-   Check to see whether the host software you are using provides a feature to check and/or adjust the volume setting.
-   If the host software does not provide that feature, request help from the development team that built the host software to check / change the volume setting. For details, see **D998200597 DynaFlex II Go Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS)**.

### How to Play a Sequence of Tones

To play a sequence of tones, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure the device is in idle state.
2.  Send an audio command to the device to play a sequence of tones. For details, see **D998200597 DynaFlex II Go Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS).**

# Introduction to User Interface

This section contains information on DynaFlex II Go's LEDs, beeper, and BCR status LED. It is important to note that DynaFlex II Go devices are equipped with an optional rechargeable battery. If there is no power supply to the device through the USB cable or optional internal rechargeable battery, all LEDs, along with the BCR status LED, will not illuminate. When this occurs, the user interface will resemble the device as shown in **Figure 71**.

As mentioned in section **1.1 Key Features and Components**, DynaFlex II Go models equipped with a barcode reader (BCR) have a similar physical appearance as models without a BCR, as shown in **Figure 71**. BCR models are equipped with a camera and a QR code located on the front side of the device.

-   DynaFlex II Go devices have a user interface composed of three elements: a visual indicator consisting of four LEDs, a beeper that produces audible alerts, and a power button see **Figure 61 - Power Button**.
-   DynaFlex II Go BCR devices have a user interface composed of four elements: a visual indicator consisting of four LEDs, a barcode reader status LED, a beeper that produces audible alerts, and a power button see **Figure 61 - Power Button**.
-   DynaFlex II Go devices do not feature input components such as touch screens.

**Figure 71 – DynaFlex II Go and DynaFlex II Go BCR**

## Component Details

1.  **LED Ordering**

The arrangement of the four LED indicators on DynaFlex II Go devices is illustrated in **Figure 72**. The LEDs are designated 1 to 4 and are ordered from left to right on the device.

![A white rectangular device with a hand pressing a button Description automatically generated](<DynaFlex II Go Images/b1a2e232dc7ededd067821b80cdf8b84.png>)

**Figure 72 - LED Ordering**

2.  **LED Status**

When DynaFlex II Go is powered on, its LEDs will illuminate green, when it is powered off, the LEDs will remain unlit.

**Figure 73** illustrates the On/Off status of the LEDs.

**Figure 73 - LED ON/OFF**

3.  **BCR Status**

DynaFlex II Go devices equipped with a bar code reader have a status LED that indicates whether the barcode feature is scanning.

![](<DynaFlex II Go Images/e9475d73642ce1b52b2da3779cfd894a.png>)![](<DynaFlex II Go Images/e9475d73642ce1b52b2da3779cfd894a.png>)

**Figure 74 - BCR Status LED**

4.  **Beeper Alert**

All DynaFlex II Go devices are equipped with a beeper that produces a short beep lasting for half a second and a long beep that lasts for one second.

## Power On via USB Cable LED Behavior

DynaFlex II Go will power on immediately when connected to USB power. A brief beep will sound, and all four LEDs will turn on for half a second, as shown in **Figure 75**. Following this, LED 1 and LED 2 will remain illuminated, while LED 3 and LED 4 will remain unlit.

![A close-up of a device Description automatically generated](<DynaFlex II Go Images/f9e9deeb6139514637f2762972a56d4a.jpg>)

**Figure 75 – LED Power on Sequence – USB Power On**

## USB Enumeration

When DynaFlex II Go is connected via USB in an idle state, it can be detected by a host through the USB HID port see **Figure 76**. After the host has connected to DynaFlex II Go, LED 1 will stay on. The device is in Ready State.

## About the Status LEDs

DynaFlex II Go provides four LEDs (see section **7.1 Component Details**), numbered LED1 through LED4, which report the device’s current operating status.

-   The meaning of each LED depends on the device’s operating mode, see section **6 Operation**. Most of the time, operators will check the device’s status using the LEDs when it is in **Active Mode** while the device is not performing a transaction.
-   LED blinking patterns have specific meanings as described in **Table 7**. A blinking LED generally means the device is actively doing something to change the state that the LED is indicating, and solid indicates a persistent state that would require an operator or cardholder to take action to change. One major exception is a device-wide functional failure state, such as a tamper state, where all LEDs flash urgently to call the attention of an advanced operator to intervene.

In this manual, specific blinking patterns are described in more detail in the sections where they are relevant. For example, information about how the LEDs show the device’s connection status is in section **4.3 Connecting DynaFlex II Go** to a Host.

Example: Device is attempting to pair with the host via Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE). |
| Short time   | LEDs sometimes light for a **short time** to indicate some process has ended (success or failure) and the device is going to transition to another state soon. Example: Successful card read.                                                                                                                  |

## Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE) LED Behavior

### Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE) Status LED 2 and LED 3

LED 2 is designated for indicating Bluetooth® connection status, not USB connection status.

-   When LED 2 is **off**, it indicates that the device is not currently connected via Bluetooth®. In most cases, this implies that the device has a Bluetooth® signal that is not connected, unless this has been intentionally disabled through configuration.
-   When LED 2 is **on**, it indicates that the device is currently connected via Bluetooth®.

LED 3 is designated for indicating readiness for Bluetooth® message exchange.

-   When LED 3 is **off**, it indicates that the Bluetooth® connection is not yet ready. This could be due to the absence of a secure connection or the non-activation of device-to-host characteristic notifications.
-   When LED 3 is **on**, it indicates that the Bluetooth® connection is ready, signaling the establishment of a secure connection and the activation of device-to-host characteristic notifications.

### Power On DynaFlex II Go in Battery Operating Mode

Press and hold the Power Button for two seconds: initially, LED 4 will light up, followed by all four LEDs illuminating for one second. This is followed by LEDs 1 and 2 remaining lit for 2 seconds, after which only LED 1 will be active.

## Power Management

### About Power

With a sufficiently charged battery, the device will power on when the power button is pressed (see **Figure 61 - Power Button**). The device will also power on when connected to USB power. In USB mode the device will remain in full power mode to provide power to device. If a power-off sequence is initiated, the device will reboot and remain in full power mode.

### How to Charge the Battery

| ![A black and white sign with letters Description automatically generated](<DynaFlex II Go Images/03555afcb3177a7ebf5f264c12d86851.png>)       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Per UL requirements, the device is designed to not recharge its internal battery when the external temperature is below 0°C or above 40°C.** |

DynaFlex II Go products have an optional rechargeable battery to supply their own power when they are not powered through the USB-C port. The battery must be periodically recharged by connecting the device to a USB port or stand-alone USB charger. The device requires a USB power supply that can provide at least **500mA @ 5V**.

To charge the device, connect it to a USB-C charger or a USB host as described in section **4.3.1 How to Connect DynaFlex II Go to a Host Computer via USB-C**. For best results, use the cable that is included with the device. When charging, make sure the device is receiving enough power from the USB connection (the battery level should increase even when the device is in use). A full recharge cycle for a completely drained battery depends on the charging method. From a host USB port at 500mA, full charge takes approximately 5 hours. From a dedicated wall charger, a full charge may take approximately 5 hours. After connecting the device to a power source, make sure the LEDs indicate the device is charging (see sec **4.3.1 How to Connect DynaFlex II Go to a Host Computer via USB-C)**

For important information about the device’s power systems, optimal charging methods during regular use, optimal handling and storage, and other information about keeping the device’s power systems in the best possible condition, see section **3.2 Handling to Avoid Accidental Tamper** and section **7.8.1 About Power**.

### How to Power On / Wake Up from Standby Mode / Power Off

To power on the device connect the device to USB power. To power off the device, disconnect the device from USB power. Press and hold the power button (see **Figure 61 - Power Button**) on the device (for two beeps), all LED indicators should power off and remain unlit. If all LEDs are off, the device is in Powered Off mode. It is important to note the device cannot be powered off when connected via USB.

### About Maintenance Reset

DynaFlex II Go will automatically reset once every 24 hours if it is continuously powered on.

## Card Reading

### About Reading Cards

The steps for starting a transaction and reading a contactless payment device are different depending on the device’s configuration and on the design of the host software. Host software developers should see section **9 Developing Custom Software** for implementation references. The solution developer should provide solution-specific instructions for operators to follow. A transaction generally follows this essential flow:

1.  An advanced operator has already made sure DynaFlex II Go is configured properly and is connected to the host (see section **4.3 Connecting DynaFlex II Go** to a Host). When the device is connected to the host and powered via the USBC connector or internal rechargeable battery, the host software may keep a connection open to the device.
2.  The operator makes sure DynaFlex II Go is receiving power either from the USB connection, or from the internal rechargeable battery, and is awake and powered on (see section **7.8.3)**
3.  The operator uses the host software’s user interface (for example, a point of sale) to finalize a transaction amount, then initiates a transaction. In solutions that are designed to respond to cardholder input events that occur when the device is idle, such as unprompted tapping of a card or electronic payment device, the host software may respond to those inputs by notifying the host. The host software may trigger other operations without being initiated by an operator (for example, the host software may immediately start a transaction, or alert the cardholder or operator to take action).
4.  The host communicates with the device, and reports to the operator when the device is ready.
5.  The operator guides and assists the cardholder in presenting payment.
6.  The cardholder interacts with the device to present payment. The following sections provide additional details about presenting each of the available payment methods.
7.  The host monitors the progress of the transaction, and when necessary, and should report issues to the operator, who may need to relay the messages to the cardholder.
8.  The device reports the success or failure of the transaction to the cardholder and to the host.

### How to Tap Contactless Cards / Devices

To tap a contactless card or smartphone, follow these steps:

1.  Check LED status:
    1.  The device shows the transaction status using the LEDs. LED1 lights solid and all other LEDs are off, per EMV standards, to indicate it is ready for a tap.
    2.  All devices report detailed transaction status to the host, and host software may report that information to operators so they can guide cardholders through the transaction (for example, “please tap your card now”).
2.  If the cardholder is using an electronic payment device, such as a smartphone, make sure the payment device has **NFC** turned **On** and has a payment app configured to process transactions. For details, see the documentation provided by the smartphone manufacturer and payment app publisher.
3.  Briefly hold the card, smartphone, or other contactless payment device over the contactless landing zone, indicated by the EMVCo Contactless Indicator symbol on the device’s face (see **Figure 18**). Because each smartphone model may have its NFC antenna placed differently, the ideal tap position may vary by make and model. For example, Samsung users may need to center the phone on the contactless landing zone, while Apple users may need to tap the top of the phone on the contactless landing zone.
4.  Wait for LED status:
    1.  The device quickly lights the second LED to show it is processing, then lights the third LED to show it has successfully read the tap, then lights the fourth LED to show the read is complete (see **Figure 19**) The device then returns to Ready State, when connected to USB ready state is LED 1 and 2 on only, ready state for BLE is LED 1,2, and 3 on.
    2.  The device beeps once.
    3.  If the transaction requires a signature, the device sends a notification message to the host that includes the status **Signature Capture Requested**. In this case, the solution design collects the cardholder’s signature manually or via a different method.
    4.  The device ends the transaction and reports the transaction status to the host.
5.  If the device cannot communicate with the card, smartphone, or other contactless payment device:
    1.  The device ends the transaction.
    2.  The device lights LED 4 for a short time.
    3.  The device beeps twice.
    4.  The device notifies the host that the transaction failed. If this occurs, the host software may choose to retry the transaction or revert to prompting the operator to perform another operation that is specific to the solution design.

### How to Scan Barcodes

To scan a barcode, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure you are using a DynaFlex II Go model that includes a barcode reader, indicated by QR Code markings on the face of the device surrounding the barcode reader lens (see section **1.1 Key Features and Components**).
2.  If the barcode being scanned is not on a self-illuminated source such as a smartphone, make sure there is enough ambient light for the camera to read the barcode. In low light conditions, the barcode reader will only be able to read self-illuminated sources.
3.  In some solutions, the operator may have to perform an operation in the host software to enable the barcode reader, or to start a transaction with the barcode reader enabled.
4.  Wait for the device, the host, or the operator to prompt for a barcode read:
    1.  The device lights the barcode reader indicator LED next to the barcode reader lens.
5.  Hold the barcode in front of the barcode reader camera:
    1.  If possible, use the light from the barcode reader indicator LED to align the barcode within the barcode reader’s field of view, which extends 16 degrees above / below and 21 degrees to the left / right of a line perpendicular to the barcode reader lens.
    2.  Hold the barcode as close as 6 inches from the lens. For smaller barcodes, the device will read immediately. If it does not, gradually move away up to 14 inches from the lens until the device reports a successful read. Larger barcodes must be far enough away from the device that the whole barcode is within the camera’s field of view; if a large barcode is too close, the barcode reader can only see a zoomed in portion of the barcode.
    3.  Do not tilt the barcode more than 60 degrees from parallel to the device’s face.
6.  Wait for the device or the host to report the barcode has been read successfully:
    1.  The device beeps once.
    2.  The device turns off the barcode reader indicator LED.

### Apple VAS for DynaFlex II Go

DynaFlex II Go products support Apple Value Added Services (Apple VAS) protocol.

Contactless transactions using the Apple VAS protocol permits the device reader to perform the following supported operations:

#### VAS App and Payment Mode (Dual Mode)

The device reads both Apple VAS data and EMV payment data from a tapped smartphone or reads EMV payment data from a tapped card. When device sends ARQC to the host to conclude the transaction, it includes EMV payment data in container FC and includes VAS data, if available, in container FE

#### VAS App Only Mode (VAS Mode)

The device reads only Apple VAS data from a tapped smartphone and does not read data from a tapped card. If the tapped smartphone does not support VAS, the device does not detect or read from the smartphone. When the device sends ARQC to conclude the transaction, it includes VAS data in container FE and does not include EMV payment data in container FC.

#### VAS App or Payment Mode (Single Mode)

The device reads only Apple VAS data from a tapped smartphone or reads EMV payment data from a tapped card. When the device sends ARQC to conclude the transaction, it only includes either EMV payment data in container FC for cards, or includes VAS data in container for smartphones.

#### Payment Only Mode (Payment Mode)

The device operates the same as EMV mode (01). It reads only EMV payment data from a tapped smartphone or a tapped card. When the device sends ARQC to conclude the transaction, it includes EMV payment data in container FC and does not include VAS data in container FE. Note: THIS MODE MAY NOT BE NEEDED.

For details, see **D998200597 DynaFlex II Go Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS).**

### How to Tap Contactless NFC Tags / MIFARE Classic / MIFARE DESFire /MIFARE Plus Cards and Send Pass-through Commands

DynaFlex II Go is compatible with near field communication (NFC) technology such as MIFARE Classic / MIFARE DESFire /MIFARE Plus contactless IC products (smart cards).

To tap an NFC Contactless IC product and send pass-through commands, follow these steps:

1.  Check LED status:
    1.  Per EMV standards, the device indicates transaction status through its LED indicators, located on the front face of the device. When ready for a tap, LED 1 is steadily illuminated while all other LEDs remain unlit.
    2.  All devices communicate transaction details to the host. The host software will relay this information to operators, allowing them to direct cardholders during the transaction, such as prompting "please tap your card now".
2.  Place the card over the device's designated contactless landing zone, marked by the EMVCo Contactless Indicator symbol on the front face of the device.
3.  Wait for LED status:
    1.  Initially, LED 2 illuminates, signaling the device is processing. The device subsequently illuminates LED 3 and LED 4, indicating card detection. Notifications are then sent to identify the card type and UID.
    2.  The Host application can further interact with the NFC Tag using pass-through commands. For details, see **D998200597 DynaFlex II Go Programmer’s Manual (COMMANDS).**
    3.  If the pass-through command is the last successful command, the device will end the transaction, emitting a single beep signaling a successful transaction. The user then needs to remove the card.
    4.  If an error is detected, the device will end the transaction and emit two beeps to signal the error. The user then needs to remove the card.
4.  The device notifies the host that the transaction has ended with the NFC Tag removed.

| **Never do any of the following:** DO NOT use a ground adapter plug to connect equipment to a power socket-outlet that lacks a ground connection terminal. DO NOT attempt any maintenance function that is not specifically described in this manual or in other ExpressCard 3000 instructional documents published by MagTek. DO NOT remove any of the covers or guards that are fastened with screws. There are no user-serviceable areas within these covers. DO NOT override or “cheat” electrical or mechanical interlock devices. DO NOT use EC3000 supplies or cleaning materials for other than their intended purposes. DO NOT operate the equipment if you or anyone else have noticed unusual noises or odors.  **Consider the following before operating the ExpressCard 3000:** Connect the EC3000 to a properly grounded AC power socket-outlet. If in doubt, have the socket-outlet checked by a qualified electrician. Improper connection of the device’s grounding conductor creates a risk of electric shock. Place the EC3000 on a solid surface that can safely support the device’s weight plus the weight of a person leaning against it (such as a service technician). Be careful when moving or relocating the device. Use proper lifting techniques. Use materials and supplies specifically designed for MagTek devices. Using unsuitable materials may result in poor performance, and in some cases may be hazardous. |
