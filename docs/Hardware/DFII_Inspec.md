## Overview

DynaFlex II products are secure card reader authenticators that deliver magstripe, EMV Contact Chip, EMV Contactless, NFC contactless, and barcode reading capability in select models. DynaFlex II provides a large contactless landing zone for a simplified user experience.

## Form Factor

Check the overall form factor for signs of attempted entry. DynaFlex II SCR products are made from molded plastic with a rubberized coating and a matching black lens on the face. Look for any added components, size, or weight. Directional icons may be printed on your device. Check for signs of cutting, tapping, and bending. There are no additional electronics or wires. Any breaks in the plastic, scuffs, or damage could be signs of physical tampering and should be reported.

### Dimensions and Weight
| Model                | Dimensions                          | Weight                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| DynaFlex II SCR      | 4.1 x 3.5 x 1.9 in. (103.3 x 95.1 x 48.5 mm) | 8.4 oz (238 g)    |
| DynaFlex II SCR BCR  | 4.1 x 3.7 x 1.9 in. (103.3 x 95.1 x 48.5 mm) | 9.52 oz (241.5 g) |

## Back/Top

The back of the device is smooth, with no extraneous wires or elements.

## Front Face

### Barcode Reader
BCR (barcode reading) devices have a camera lens surrounded by a barcode icon. In barcode reader models, a barcode reader is located along the top of the reader.

### Chip Card Insertion Slot
The card slot for the EMV Contact Chip Reader is a smooth, unobstructed path. Other than the contact points that read the chip, there are no electronics, mechanics, or wires in the path.

### LEDs
There are four LED lights between the chip card insertion slot and the magnetic stripe swipe path. These provide signals to the user. See the installation and operation manual for complete LED signaling.

### Swipe Path
The swipe path is smooth. The only moving part is the spring-mounted read head that depresses into the device as the card’s magnetic stripe makes contact with the read head. There are no mechanics, electronics, or wires in the path.

### Contactless Landing Zone
Contactless landing zone is a smooth front cover with no moving parts and only the contactless symbol in the landing zone. The contactless indicator mark’s orientation may vary.

## Sides

The left and right sides are smooth plastic.

## Bottom

### Product Label
The product label is located on the underside of the device. The Serial Number, Rev, Date, Part number (PN), MAC ID (MAC), and Hardware PN (HW) are listed as appropriate.

### Certificate Logos
Certification logos and patent information are imprinted in the plastic form factor.

### USB-C Cable
The device uses a USB-C cable with ferrite sleeve at each end to power and charge. Ensure there are no extraneous cables. USB-C connection is on the underside of the device. Ensure the cable is connected directly to the correct host USB port.

### Pushbutton
There is a tactile switch/button.

### FCC/IC Label
The FCC/IC label lists the product model name, FCC ID, and IC numbers.

### Charging
There are four (4) charging contacts on the underside of the device.

### Rubberized Feet
There are three (3) rubberized feet on the underside of the device, these lay flat and are form-fitted with no extraneous cables or edges.

## Quick Inspection

As part of your inspection, include the following for your device inspection audit:
- Be certain to have a list of the devices and include the details listed on the product label.
- It may be helpful to take photos of the front, back, and side of each device.

## Tripped Device

If there is forced entry, the security switches built into the electronics will be tripped. If they are tripped, sensitive data such as encryption keys and certificates are cleared as part of security measures mandated by PCI and the device will not be available to make transactions.

**NOTICE:** If the security switches have been tripped, DynaFlex II PED products cannot be repaired in the field and must go back to the factory for repair. Follow RMA procedures. Users must report all signs of tampering as per standard protocol.

## Certifications and Validation

### PCI Device Validation
To check for PCI Validation, check the Hardware and Firmware ID:
- **Hardware ID:** Printed on the label.
- **Firmware ID:** Accessible via the device and displayed on the screen.

Go to the PCI compliance web page and search for MagTek, and find the product name, DynaFlex II. Compare the Hardware ID and Firmware ID: [PCI Compliance Webpage](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solutions/pin_transaction_devices)
