# MagTek Docs

Welcome to the **MagTek Docs** developer documentation portal. This site consolidates technical resources for developers and integrators working with MagTek’s secure payment hardware. Whether you are installing a device, integrating with SDKs, or programming against the MagTek Messaging Schema (MMS), you’ll find structured documentation here.

## How to Use This Portal

- **New users** → start with [Setup & Devices](/setup/) for installation and operation manuals.  
- **Developers and system integrators** → consult the [Web Docs](/web-docs/) for the authoritative MMS and V5 programming specifications. Web Docs include both atomic references (commands, properties, notifications) and links to legacy PDF manuals.  
- **Application teams** → refer to the [SDK Guides](/sdks/) for sample code and platform-specific integration.

# Documentation Families

**🔧 Installation & Operation Manuals**  
Step-by-step setup and usage guides for each device family. Covers hardware installation, environment requirements, and daily operation.

**📘 Programmer’s Manuals**  
Authoritative MMS specifications for each device family.

- **Scope:** command groups (e.g., 0x10nn, 0x11nn), configuration properties, notifications/response formats, and device-specific behavior.
- **Formats:**
  - **Legacy PDF (“Master Manual”)** — comprehensive, single-volume reference.
  - **Web Docs (atomic)** — each command, property, and notification is an individual, linkable page for faster search and cross-reference.

During the transition, some families may offer both; **Web Docs** are the primary source.

**💻 SDK Guides & Sample Code**  
Integration resources for .NET, Java, iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows. Includes sample projects and platform-specific notes to accelerate development.
