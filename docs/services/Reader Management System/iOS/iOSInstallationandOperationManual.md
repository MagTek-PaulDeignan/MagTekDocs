# Overview

The MagTek Reader Management System (RMS) is a comprehensive application with
specialized source code designed to streamline the configuration and update
process for MagTek readers in enterprise environments. Its primary functions
include firmware management, key injection, device configuration, and the
loading and management of terminal, application settings, and Certificate
Authority Public Keys (CAPKs) required for EMV contactless transactions.

## Purpose

The Reader Management System (RMS) application is designed to be compatible with
all DynaFlex, DynaProx, and MagneSafe products available from MagTek.

-   The main purpose of this app is to streamline the ability to load firmware,
    device configs, keys, Tags and CAPKs into a target reader or more
    importantly, a large quantity of geographically separated readers.
-   The target files are 100% MagTek managed (files managed at MagTek’s host) so
    the user is not able to load the wrong files by accident.
-   The app can auto execute or manually execute the update process which can
    include all of the above file options in a single action. This prevents the
    need to load individual files which is cumbersome and not practical for
    scale.
-   The source code can be used to integrate this functionality into 3rd party
    apps which makes it easier for developers to use Magensa Remote Services.

## Benefits

The MagTek Reader Management System (RMS) provides several key benefits for
merchants and businesses, these include:

1.  **Centralized Management**: RMS allows for the remote management and
    configuration of MagTek readers across multiple locations from a single
    platform. Merchants can update firmware, keys, terminal settings, and CAPKs
    without manual intervention, reducing time, cost, and effort.
2.  **Enhanced Security**: RMS supports compliance with industry standards, such
    as PCI DSS, by ensuring secure payment card transactions and protecting
    sensitive customer data. It enables a secure process for keeping readers up
    to date with the latest firmware and configurations.
3.  **Efficient Updates**: RMS automates firmware updates and maintenance,
    allowing merchants to push updates remotely. This ensures all devices run
    the latest firmware, enhancing system reliability and reducing the need for
    manual updates.
4.  **System Reporting**: RMS offers reporting capabilities to track firmware
    versions and device settings, providing detailed insights by serial number
    for firmware, terminal, and CAPK updates in both production and test
    environments.
5.  **Scalability and Flexibility**: RMS is scalable to meet the needs of
    businesses, whether for a single store or multiple locations. It supports
    both iOS, Android and Windows, allowing flexibility in device management.
    (*See each OS specific installation manual for further details*)
6.  **Cost Savings**: Automating reader management with RMS reduces the need for
    on-site visits, lowering maintenance costs and minimizing downtime.
    Centralized control streamlines administrative tasks, boosting operational
    efficiency.
7.  **Improved Customer Experience**: Efficiently managed payment readers reduce
    transaction errors and delays, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty,
    which positively impacts business reputation and revenue.

### iOS System Requirements

The RMS app is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, iPad OS.

**Note:** Not all configuration options are available for all Secure Card Reader
Authenticators (SCRAs). The available configuration options depend on:

-   The specific SCRA model in use.
-   The configuration options provided by MagTek.

    **Important**: Some commands may require a device reset.

-   Refer to the Programmer's Manual for your particular device to see which
    commands are affected. (See **Appendix B Related Documentation**.)

### RMS iOS Application

-   iOS Application V1 (PN 1000009406)

    V2 (PN 1000009755)

-   Compatible with both USB and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connected readers,
    as well as WLAN enabled readers.
-   Supports MagTek MagneSafe and DynaFlex/DynaProx readers.

**Note**: As of March 4, 2025, MagTek advises all current RMS V1 users to
upgrade to V2 as soon as possible. While V1 is still supported, future firmware
updates, EMV tags, and CAPKs will not be implemented on RMS V1.

# Magensa Remote Services

-   Customer needs a Remote Services (RS) Account for billable services
-   Customer DOES NOT need an RS Account for non-billable services
-   Billing occurs upon RS activity (this middleware does NOT impact the billing
    mechanics with RS)
-   Middleware between Magensa RS and Client App

Its main differentiator is to allow a developer or user to auto-launch or
single-click within their app to perform:

1.  Loads Firmware for V5 readers
2.  Main FW and BLE FW
3.  By Device ID so blending readers across various generations with differing
    FW files
4.  Loads Terminal and Application Settings
5.  Loads CAPKs
6.  Loads keys
7.  Load Device Configs
