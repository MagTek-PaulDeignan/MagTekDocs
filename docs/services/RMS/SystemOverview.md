# Purpose
The Reader Management System (RMS) application is designed to be compatible with all DynaFlex, DynaProx, and MagneSafe products available from MagTek. 
* The main purpose of this app is to streamline the ability to load firmware, device configs, keys, Tags and CAPKs into a target reader or more importantly, a large quantity of geographically separated readers.
* The target files are 100% MagTek managed (files managed at MagTekâ€™s host) so the user is not able to load the wrong files by accident.
* The app can auto execute or manually execute the update process which can include all of the above file options in a single action.  This prevents the need to load individual files which is cumbersome and not practical for scale.
* The source code can be used to integrate this functionality into 3rd party apps which makes it easier for developers to use Magensa Remote Services.
# Benefits
The MagTek Reader Management System (RMS) provides several key benefits for merchants and businesses, these include:
1.	Centralized Management: RMS allows for the remote management and configuration of MagTek readers across multiple locations from a single platform. Merchants can update firmware, keys, terminal settings, and CAPKs without manual intervention, reducing time, cost, and effort.
2.	Enhanced Security: RMS supports compliance with industry standards, such as PCI DSS, by ensuring secure payment card transactions and protecting sensitive customer data. It enables a secure process for keeping readers up to date with the latest firmware and configurations.
3.	Efficient Updates: RMS automates firmware updates and maintenance, allowing merchants to push updates remotely. This ensures all devices run the latest firmware, enhancing system reliability and reducing the need for manual updates.
4.	System Reporting: RMS offers reporting capabilities to track firmware versions and device settings, providing detailed insights by serial number for firmware, terminal, and CAPK updates in both production and test environments.
5.	Scalability and Flexibility: RMS is scalable to meet the needs of businesses, whether for a single store or multiple locations. It supports both Android, iOS and Windows, allowing flexibility in device management. (See each OS specific installation manual for further details)
6.	Cost Savings: Automating reader management with RMS reduces the need for on-site visits, lowering maintenance costs and minimizing downtime. Centralized control streamlines administrative tasks, boosting operational efficiency.
7.	Improved Customer Experience: Efficiently managed payment readers reduce transaction errors and delays, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty, which positively impacts business reputation and revenue.
