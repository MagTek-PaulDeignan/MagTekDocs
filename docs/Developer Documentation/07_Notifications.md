# Notifications

This section provides definitions and practical information about **Notification Message**s, which follow the format described in section **3.2.2.3**. To find documentation about a specific notification:

1.  Use the **Notification Source** byte in the message to find the Notification Source subsection below. For example, Notification Source **0x01 Transaction** leads to subsection **7.1 Notification Source 0x01nn - Notifications from Transactions**.
2.  Within that subsection, use the **Notification Source** byte plus the **Notification Type** byte in the message to find the Notification subsection. For example, Notification Source **0x01 Transaction** plus Notification Type **0x01 Information Update** leads to **Notification 0x0101 - Transaction Information Update**.
3.  Within that subsection, use the four bytes of **Notification Detail Code** in the message to look up the notification in the **Notification Detail Code** table. For example, **0x07080302** leads to a row in **Table 297** that provides practical information about what event led to the notification, and how to interpret the Notification Payload.

## Notification Source 0x01nn - Notifications from Transactions

### Notification 0x0101 - Transaction Information Update

This notification reports information about progress and state changes that occur during a transaction.

For this notification, **Notification Detail** described in section **3.2.2.3 Notification Message** contains one byte each, shown in **Table 297**, to indicate:

-   The **Payment Technology** (PT) involved
-   The **Reason** (Rsn) for the notification
-   **Detail** (Det) about the notification that has different meanings depending on the Reason, and
-   An **Extra** field (Ext) that has different meanings depending on the Reason.

## Notification Source 0x10nn - Notifications from Device

### Notification 0x1001 - Device Information Update

This notification reports information about general state changes that occur within the device, outside the context of specific operations like transactions (**Notification Source 0x01nn - Notifications from Transactions**), requests the host receives from the firmware’s integrated display interface (**Notification Source 0x18nn - Notifications from User Interface**), and so on.

For this notification, **Notification Detail** described in section **3.2.2.3 Notification Message** contains one byte each, shown in **Table 320** **below**, to indicate:

-   The **Category** (Cat) of notification (for example, the subsystem the notification is originating from)
-   The **Reason** (Rsn) for the notification (Device Event)
-   **Detail** (Det) about the notification that has different meanings depending on the Reason, and
-   An **Extra** field (Ext) that has different meanings depending on the Reason.

The other optional message parameters in the **Notification Message** depend on which combination of four bytes is included in **Notification Detail**, and are described in **Table 320**.

| Category **0x01 User Event** contains notification detail codes involving events triggered by user actions. Each possible notification has a unique **Reason** value: Reason 0x00 = Contactless Card Presented (EMV Contactless Only) Reason 0x01 = Contactless Card Removed (EMV Contactless Only) Reason 0x02 = Card Seated in Slot (EMV Contact Only) Reason 0x03 = Card Unseated from Slot (EMV Contact Only) Reason 0x04 = Card Swiped (MSR Only) Reason 0x05 = Touch Sensor Press On Display (Touch Only) Reason 0x06 = Touch Sensor Release On Display (Touch Only) Reason 0x07 = Barcode Read (BCR Only) The host can use **Property 1.2.7.1.2.1 User Event Notification Controls** Enable to enable these notification reasons individually. The host may choose to use these notifications to determine when to send additional commands. For example, it may send **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction**. The host should do this as quickly as possible to minimize the response time between when the cardholder presents a card and when the device provides feedback via a visible or audible state change or attempts to read a chip card. Note there are cases where the device may send a notification with **Reason** = **Contactless Card Presented** while the cardholder is inserting or swiping a card, so the host should start transactions with all supported card interfaces enabled to maximize the chances of a successful card read. |     |     |     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### Notification 0x1001 – Low Battery Warning

The device sends this notification when the battery charge reaches 15 percent. If a device is powered on with a charge that is already 15 percent or below, this notification is sent shortly after power up and includes the current battery charge percentage. Percent indicates the percent of battery charge remaining. It is recommended that the device is charged using a USB power source soon after receiving this notification. See **Table 13 - Notification Message Format** and **Table 321 Low Battery Notification Example**.

#### Notification 0x1001 - Low Battery Shutdown

The device sends this notification one minute before it automatically powers down the device. This occurs when the battery charge has reached 0 percent. Shutdown can be prevented by connecting the device to a USB power source. See **Table 13 - Notification Message Format** and **Table 322 Low Battery Shutdown Response Example**.

#### Notification 0x1001 - Battery Charged

The device sends this notification when the battery charger detects that the battery is fully charged. This only occurs when the device is powered by a USB power source. See **Table 13 - Notification Message Format** and **Table 323 - Battery Charged Notification Example**.

This notification is for simple messages. The host should show the requested message until another notification arrives or until the host needs to use the display for its own purposes. For example, during a transaction, this notification will pass along the simple messages in the transaction sequence like **CARD READ OK - REMOVE CARD**, **THANK YOU**, and **WELCOME**.                                                              |

The host should show the requested message and should allow the request to be canceled by a cardholder or operator. For example, during a transaction, this notification will pass along the simple messages in the transaction sequence like “TAP, INSERT, or SWIPE CARD,” where cancelation is appropriate. If the cancel button involves canceling the whole transaction, the host should send **Command 0x1008 - Cancel Transaction**. |
