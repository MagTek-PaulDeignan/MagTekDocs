# Messages (Requests, Responses, Notifications, and Files)

This section describes the general format of messages exchanged between hosts and devices that are using the common MMS message framework.

Documentation about the specific messages supported by a given device is provided in section **6 Commands**.

## About Messages

The host and the device communicate with each other by exchanging blocks of data called **Messages**, which are standardized wrappers containing a **payload** that is either a command **Request**, a command **Response**, an unsolicited **Notification**, or a **File**. For example, the host may send a command **request** message to the device to change a configuration setting, and the device may send a command **response** message to indicate the command was successful; when a cardholder inserts a card, the device may send a **notification** message to the host that a cardholder has initiated a transaction; the host may send the device a **file** message to load firmware.

Messages can be nested. For example, a top-level secure wrapper request from the host to the device may contain an encrypted or signed command request for the device to unpack, validate, and execute.

**Requests and Responses.** Requests and responses are two of the message payload types the host and device exchange inside messages. The combination of a message that contains a **request** payload and a message that contains the corresponding **response** payload is referred to generally in this document as a **Command**. The device can only service one command request at a time, and sends each command response within a pre-determined finite amount of time after receiving the request. After sending a command request, the host must wait until the device returns a response before sending another request, or until the request is unanswered after a reasonable host-defined timeout period passes.

**Notifications.** Notifications are a message payload type the host and device exchange inside messages. The device sends notification messages to the host if the device’s state changes or if an external event occurs, such as a cardholder inserting a card. The device can send a notification at any time, and does not expect a response or any specific action from the host. By default, the device sends all notifications to the USB interface. To configure the device to send notifications on additional connections, use **Command 0x1F02 - Set Notification Subscriptions**.

**Data Files**. Data Files are a message payload type the host and device exchange inside messages. The device handles them as a stream, in that it begins storing the payload of the message before it has received the final packet of the message, allowing for much larger payloads than standard requests. This is made possible by restricting the function of the message to just transferring a file, which means restricting the message payload to primitive data only; it cannot contain composed TLV data objects.

Regardless of connection type, all MMS devices use the same schema for sending and receiving messages, which is documented in section **3.2 Message Format**. For information about transmitting and receiving messages using specific connection types, which involves following connection-specific rules for breaking messages down into transmittable **Message Streams**, see section **2 Connection Types**.

## Message Format

### Tag-Length-Value (TLV) Encoding

#### About TLV Encoding

All messages exchanged between the host and the device are formatted using the tag-length-value **Distinguished Encoding Rules** (DER) defined in **ITU-T X.680\|ISO/IEC 8824-1** and **ITU-T X.690\|ISO/IEC 8825-1**. A subset of these standards is also used in **EMV Integrated Circuit Card Specifications for Payment Systems 4.3, Part IV, Annex B Rules for BER-TLV Data Objects**, so the latter can serve as a useful point of reference, especially for developers who are familiar with systems that exchange blocks of EMV data.

Summarizing those specifications, each TLV data object follows these basic rules:

-   The DER standard designates the least significant bit of a byte as **bit 1**, and the most significant bit of a byte as **bit 8**. This is different from the remainder of the MMS standard, which indexes bit numbers starting at 0 to be consistent with each bit position number representing that bit’s power of 2.
-   The **Tag** or **Identifier** portion of a TLV data object identifies the TLV data object. This standard assigns the **tag** (identifier) portion of TLV data objects according to the DER format as follows:
    -   Bits 8 and 7 specify whether the TLV data object is universal, application-defined, context-specific, or private. Most messages in this standard contain **context-specific** tags (bits 8 and 7 = **10**), meaning different messages reuse the same tags, and the tags represent sequentially numbered parameters passed in any message. The contents of each context-specific tag (parameter) are described for each message in section **6 Commands**.
    -   Bit 6 specifies whether the tag is **primitive** (bit 6=**0**), meaning it contains its values directly, or **constructed** (bit 6=**1**), meaning the TLV data object contains more TLV data objects.
    -   Bits 5 to 1 specify a unique tag number, with 11111 reserved to mean:
        -   The tag is not a single byte long
        -   Bits 7 to 1 of subsequent bytes with bit 8 set to 1 are also part of the tag identifier with the most significant of the whole tag number in bit 7
        -   Bits 7 to 1 of the final byte with bit 8 set to 0 is also part of the tag identifier
-   The **Length** portion is calculated as the total length of the Data portion that follows it: Lengths can be either short form or long form:
    -   **Short form** means the length is one byte long in the range 0x00 to 0x7F.
    -   **Long form** means the length is multiple bytes long, starting with one-byte 0x80 or greater, where the lower 7 bits specify how many subsequent bytes are used to indicate the length. For example, in the case of length 8201C3, 0x82 is greater than 0x7F, and the lower 7 bits equal 0x02, so the next 2 bytes 0x01C3 give the total length of the data block, 451 bytes.
    -   DER format stipulates all TLV data objects should be encoded using the smallest length required to fit the data.
-   The **Value** or **Data** portion is the actual payload of the TLV data object.

This document provides message definitions in hexadecimal format; when the host constructs or interprets a message, if no additional encode / decode filtering or translation is in place at the platform layer, it should expect each hexadecimal value shown in this document to be represented as binary bytes in the message stream, not as string literals. For example, FF is a single byte with all bits set to 1, not the two-byte string literal “FF.”

#### TLV Example

Below is a brief example of a TLV-encoded request and response for **Command 0xDF01 - Echo**, wrapped in the standard message format documented in section **3.2.2 Message Structure**.

The host sends the device a binary byte stream AA0081040101DF018407DF018103010203, which breaks down as follows:

-   AA00 = Standard **Start of Message** / **API Framework Version** (not TLV)
-   81, 04, 0101DF01
    -   Tag 81 = Request Message Parameter 1, **Message Information**
    -   Length 04
    -   Value 0101DF01
        -   01 = Request from host to device
        -   01 = Message reference number
        -   DF01 = **Command 0xDF01 - Echo**
-   84, 07, DF018103010203
    -   Tag 84 = Request Message Parameter 4, **Request Payload**
    -   Length 07
    -   Value DF018103010203
        -   DF01 = Payload format is for Request **Command 0xDF01 - Echo** (not TLV)
        -   Tag 81 = Payload Parameter 1, **Value to Echo**
        -   Length 03
        -   Value 010203 = Value to Echo 010203

In response, the device sends the host a binary byte stream AA0081048201DF018204000000008407DF018103010203, which breaks down as follows:

-   AA00 = Standard **Start of Message** / **API Framework Version** (not TLV)
-   81, 04, 8201DF01
    -   Tag 81 = Response Message Parameter 1, **Message Information**
    -   Length 04
    -   Value 8201DF01
        -   82 = Response from device to host
        -   01 = Message reference number
        -   DF01 = **Command 0xDF01 - Echo**
-   82, 04, 00000000
    -   Tag 82 = Response Message Parameter 2, **Response Status** (one byte **Operation Status Summary**, three bytes **Operation Status Detail**)
    -   Length 04
    -   Value 00, 000000 = OK / Done, General / All Good / Requested operation was successful
-   84, 07, DF018103010203
    -   Tag 84 = Response Message Parameter 4 for **Response Payload**
    -   Length 07
    -   Value DF018103010203
        -   DF01 = Payload format is for Response **Command 0xDF01 - Echo** (not TLV)
        -   Tag 81 = Payload Parameter 1, **Value to Echo**
        -   Length 03
        -   Value 010203 = Value to Echo 010203

#### How to Read TLV Tables

Throughout this document, tables that show TLV data objects use some number of slashes in front of the **Tag** identifier to indicate that object’s *relative* level of nesting / containment within other TLV data objects *in the same table*. These levels should not be assumed to be absolute levels, because a given TLV data object may be nested within other TLV data objects at any level. The slash notation saves table space compared to whitespace indenting and is easier to read than a separate “Nesting Level” column, which can be difficult to notice.

For example:

-   **Earth** contains
-   **/North America**, which contains
-   **//United States**, which contains
-   **///California**.

Although **Earth** is a *relative* root within the context of the objects above, it is not an *absolute* root, because the nested objects starting with the **Earth** relative root could be wrapped inside another object representing **Sol Solar System**, and that could be wrapped in **Milky Way Galaxy**, and so on.

In tables that show TLV data objects, a Length of **var** means the length is variable, and the device or host must calculate it based on whatever is nested inside the TLV data object.

See [Table 3.21](#table-3-21) **below** for an example.

| A1     | var | TLV data object **A1** contains four directly nested TLV data objects: 81, 82, A3, and 84 for short, or more precisely A1/81, A1/82, A1/A3, and A1/84. A1/82 is optional (Req = **O**), so the length of A1 will vary depending on whether or not A1/82 is included (Len = **var**) or excluded / left implicit.                       | T   | R   |          |
| /81    | 01  | TLV data object A1/81 contains one byte and is required. It has no default value because it must be explicitly included.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | B   | R   |          |
| /82    | 03  | TLV data object A1/82 contains three bytes but is optional. If it is not included in this object, the device (or host) assumes the default value 0x4D6F6D.                                                                                                                                                                             | B   | O   | 0x4D6F6D |
| /A3    | 08  | TLV data object A1/A3 contains two TLV data objects: 81 and 82, or more precisely, A1/A3/81 and A1/A3/82. Its length is the combined length of its two nested objects: 5 bytes for 81 (tag **81**, length **03**, value **xx xx xx**) and 3 bytes for 82 (tag **82**, length **01**, value **xx**).                                    | T   | R   |          |

| /84    | 03  | TLV data object A1/84 contains three bytes that represent distinct values, but to save space, they are length-delimited directly inside A1/84, instead of being assigned their own individual nested TLV data objects. The length of A1/84 is simply the combination of three single bytes.                                            | B   | R   |          |
| //null | (1) | This is just a raw byte inside 84. As a simple byte, it has no tag-length-value structure of its own, so its Tag is shown here as **/null**, and its length is in parentheses to indicate it is not encoded as a TLV data object, it is simply a byte count that can be used to “slice apart” the contents of 84 into separate values. | B   | R   |          |
| //null | (1) | This is another byte contained by 84.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | B   | R   |          |
| //null | (1) | This is another byte contained by 84.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | B   | R   |          |

At minimum, every device MagTek ever produces using the MMS framework will accept this value. 0x01 = First Production release (no breaking changes) 0x02 = Second Production release Etc. |       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |     |         |

The device includes the same number in the corresponding response(s). MagTek recommends using a simple incrementing counter per request the host sends during a session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | B   | R   |         |

The first byte is the Command Group number, which groups functionally related requests, and the second byte is the Command number within that group. If the **Request Payload** in the message contains wrappers, the host should specify the command it is invoking at the core of the request after all wrappers have been removed. This value is included primarily for performance and key conservation; the device simply uses it to make sure it is in a mode where it is capable of processing the desired command before it begins processing the **Request Payload**. | B   | R   |         |

| One-byte standard **API Framework Version** constant, not in TLV format, used for tracking version compatibility. Devices that implement higher (newer) versions of the API framework are designed to be reasonably compatible with current and previous (lower) versions: 0x00 = Pre-production development (limited breaking changes). At minimum, every device MagTek ever produces using the MMS framework will accept this value. 0x01 = First Production release (no breaking changes) 0x02 = Second Production release Etc. |       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |     |     |         |

#### Data File Message

This message type is used exclusively for transferring larger blocks of data that can overwhelm the standard message queue. The payload data for each message is always be treated as an individual file. This message is only valid after a successful invocation of **Command 0xD811 - Start Send File to Device (Secured)**, **Command 0xD812 - Start Send File to Device (Unsecured)**, or **Command 0xD821 - Start Get File from Device**.

| One-byte standard **API Framework Version** constant, not in TLV format, used for tracking version compatibility. Devices that implement higher (newer) versions of the API framework are designed to be reasonably compatible with current and previous (lower) versions: 0x00 = Pre-production development (limited breaking changes). At minimum, every device MagTek ever produces using the MMS framework will accept this value. 0x01 = First Production release (no breaking changes) 0x02 = Second Production release Etc. |     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |     |         |
