## Running the Demo

To run the demo, execute the following steps:

1)  Power the device from a USB charger. The device will boot. Do not
    remove power until you are finished running the demo. Wait for the
    device to display the Welcome screen.

2)  On the back of the device, near the USB port, is a small oval
    button. Press and hold the button until the device beeps exactly
    five times then release the button.

3)  A series of short beeps will sound to indicate that the demo has
    started. If an image has been stored in the fourth image file, the
    image will be displayed. If no image has been saved, the device will
    prompt for a card. If the device has a barcode reader, the prompt
    will also prompt for a barcode and the barcode reader’s light will
    turn on. The first LED will be green, and the rest will be off.

4)  Insert, tap, or swipe a card or scan a barcode.

5)  When a card or barcode is read, the device will sound a specific
    number of beeps, display a results text and light an LED. The
    following table shows the result of each type of read:

<table>
<caption><p>Table 1192 - LED Display</p></caption>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 22%" />
<col style="width: 13%" />
<col style="width: 16%" />
<col style="width: 46%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">Reader</th>
<th>Beeps</th>
<th>LED</th>
<th>Displayed Text</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Barcode</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1<sup>st</sup> Blue</td>
<td>“MSR Read Successful”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MSR</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>2<sup>nd</sup> Blue</td>
<td><p>“Contactless EMV Read</p>
<p>Successful”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contact</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>3<sup>rd</sup> Blue</td>
<td><p>“Contact EMV Read</p>
<p>Successful”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contactless</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>4<sup>th</sup> Blue</td>
<td>“MSR Read Successful”</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

6)  The results will display for four seconds.

7)  If a card is still in the contact reader or in range of the
    contactless reader, a prompt to remove the card will be displayed
    and an error beep l also sound about once a second until the card is
    removed.

8)  Return to step 3.
