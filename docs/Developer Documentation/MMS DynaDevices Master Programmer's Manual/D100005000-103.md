# Introduction

## About This Document

This document describes how to communicate with Secure Card Reader Authenticator
(SCRA) devices which implement MagTek Messaging Schema (MMS) and the DynaFlex
family, DynaFlex II Go and DynaProx system architecture.

This document also describes how to communicate with PIN Entry Devices (PED)
which implement MagTek Messaging Schema (MMS) and the DynaFlex/DynaProx family
system architecture. (PED ONLY)

The document uses **bold face** to:

-   Highlight terms / concepts being formally defined in the current sentence /
    paragraph
-   Highlight important distinguishing keywords in sentences
-   Indicate hyperlinks to other sections / tables

The document uses a small number of annotation standards that are important to
understand:

-   Hexadecimal values are prefixed with **0x** unless the context clearly
    indicates an un-prefixed number is hexadecimal (for example, TLV tags,
    lengths, and values are always assumed to be hex).
-   Binary values are prefixed with **0b** unless the context clearly indicates
    the value is binary.
-   Decimal values are not prefixed unless required for clarity, in which case
    the prefix is **0d**.

The standard documented by this document makes extensive use of Tag-Length-Value
encoding. Section **3.2.1 Tag-Length-Value (TLV) Encoding** describes how to
encode and decode TLV, and how to read the tables in this document that describe
TLV data objects.

## About Terminology

The general terms “device” and “host” are used in different, often incompatible
ways in a multitude of specifications and contexts. For instance, the term
"host" can signify different things depending on the context—such as USB
communication versus networked financial transaction processing. In this
document, "device" and "host" are defined specifically as follows:

-   **Device** refers to the Secure Card Reader Authenticator (SCRA) or PIN
    Entry Device (PED) that receives and responds to the command set specified
    in this document. Refer to **Table 3 - Device Features**, to determine a
    device’s specific capabilities, not all devices support PIN entry. Devices
    include DynaFlex, DynaProx, DynaFlex II, and so on.
-   **Host** refers to the piece of general-purpose electronic equipment the
    device is connected or paired to, which can send data to and receive data
    from the device. Host types include PC and Mac computers/laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, teletype terminals, and even test harnesses. In many cases the
    host may have custom software installed on it that communicates with the
    device. When “host” must be used differently, it is qualified as something
    specific, such as “acquirer host” or “USB host.”

Similarly, the word “user” is used in different ways in different contexts. This
document separates users into more descriptive categories:

-   The **cardholder**
-   The **operator** (such as a cashier, bank teller, customer service
    representative, or server), and
-   The **developer** or the **administrator** (such as an integrator
    configuring the device for the first time).

Because some connection types, payment brands, and other vocabulary name spaces
(notably Bluetooth® LE, EMV, smart phones, and more recent versions of Windows)
use very specific meanings for the term “Application,” this document favors the
term **host software** to refer to software on the host that provides a user
interface for the operator.

The combination of device(s), host(s), host software, device firmware, device
configuration settings, physical mounting and environment, user experience, and
documentation is referred to as the **solution**.

## About SDKs and Sample Code

MagTek provides convenient SDKs and corresponding documentation for many
programming languages and operating systems. The API libraries included in the
SDKs wrap the details of the connection in an interface that conceptually
parallels the device’s internal operation, freeing software developers to focus
on the business logic, without having to deal with the complexities of platform
APIs for connecting to the various available connection types, communicating
using the various available protocols, and parsing the various available data
formats. Information about using MagTek wrapper APIs is available in separate
documentation, including:

-   **D998200380 MagTek Universal SDK Programmer’s Manual (Microsoft .NET)**
-   **D998200381 MagTek Universal SDK Programmer’s Manual (Microsoft C++ )**
-   **D998200385 MagTek Universal SDK Programmer’s Manual (Java)**
-   **D998200386 MagTek Universal SDK Programmer’s Manual (iOS)**
-   **D998200387 MagTek Universal SDK Programmer’s Manual (Android)**
-   **D998200388 MagTek Universal SDK Programmer’s Manual (macOS)**

The documentation is bundled with the SDKs themselves, which include:

-   **1000007351 MagTek Universal SDK for MMS Devices (Windows)**
-   **1000007352 MagTek Universal SDK for MMS Devices (Android)**
-   **1000007353 MagTek Universal SDK for MMS Devices (iOS)**
-   **1000007354 MagTek Universal SDK for MMS Devices (macOS)**

The SDKs and corresponding documentation include:

-   Functions for sending the direct commands described in this manual
-   Wrappers for commonly used commands that further simplify development
-   Sample source code to demonstrate how to communicate with the device using
    the direct commands described in this manual

To download the SDKs and documentation, search
[www.MagTek.com](http://www.magtek.com) for “SDK” and select the SDK and
documentation for the programming languages and platforms you need or contact
MagTek Support Services for assistance.

Software developers also have the option to revert to direct communication with
the device using libraries available in the chosen development framework. For
example, custom software written in Visual Basic or visual C++ may make API
calls to the standard Windows USB HID driver. This document provides information
and support for developing host software using that method.

MagTek has also developed sample software that demonstrates direct communication
with the device, which software developers can use to test the device and which
provides a starting point for developing other software. For more information,
see the MagTek web site, or contact your reseller or MagTek Support Services.

## About Connections and Data Formats

MMS products transmit data using a set of common data formats across a variety
of physical connection layers, which can include universal serial bus (USB)
acting as a vendor-defined HID device (“USB HID”), wireless LAN (WLAN),
Bluetooth®, Bluetooth® Low Energy (“Bluetooth® LE”), RS-232, Apple Lightning,
and so on. The set of available physical connection types and the data formats
available on each connection type is device dependent. **Table 2** shows the
physical connection types available on each product, and the data formats
supported on each connection type for that device. Details about connection
types and formats can be found in section **2 Connection Types**. Section
headings in this document include tags that indicate which connection types
and/or data formats they apply to.

## About Device Features

Much of the information in this document is applicable to multiple devices. When
developing solutions that use a specific device or set of devices, integrators
must be aware of each device’s connection types, data formats, features, and
configuration options, which affect the availability and behavior of some
commands. **Table 3** provides a list of device features that may impact command

# Connection Types

**Table 2** on page **36** includes a list of connection types available for
each device. The following subsections provide details developers will need to
communicate with the device using each connection type.

## How to Use USB Connections (USB Only)

These USB devices conform to the USB specification revision 1.1. They also
conform to the Human Interface Device (HID) class specification version 1.1.
This document assumes the audience is familiar with USB HID class
specifications, which are available at [**www.usb.org**](http://www.usb.org).
MagTek strongly recommends becoming familiar with that standard before trying to
communicate with the device directly via USB.

These devices are full-speed, high-powered USB devices that draw power from the
USB bus they are connected to. They enter and wake up from Suspend mode when
directed to do so by the USB host. They do not support remote wakeup.

When connecting via USB, MMS devices connect to the USB host as a
**vendor-defined** Human Interface Device. MMS devices identify themselves to
the host with MagTek’s vendor ID **0x0801**. DynaFlex products report as Product
ID (PID) **0x2020**, DynaProx products report as Product ID (PID) **0x2023 and
DynaFlex II Go report as Product ID (PID) 0x2024**.

Details for exchanging messages with the device are provided in the sections
that follow.

### About USB Reports, Usages, Usage Pages, and Usage IDs

All USB HID devices send and receive data using **Reports**. Each report may
contain several sections, called **Usages**, each of which has its own unique
four-byte (32-bit) identifier. The two most significant bytes of a usage are
called the **usage page**, and the two least significant bytes are called the
**usage ID**. Vendor-defined HID device usages must have a usage page in the
range **0xFF00 - 0xFFFF**, and it is common practice for related usage IDs share
the same usage page. For these reasons, all usages for MMS devices use
vendor-defined usage page **0xFF00**, **Magnetic Stripe Reader**.

HID reports used by the host can be divided into two types:

-   **Output Reports**, which the host uses to send messages (such as commands)
    to the device.
-   **Input Reports**, which the device uses to send messages (such as responses
    and unsolicited notifications) to the host.

For information about using output reports to send command messages to / receive
response messages from the device, see section **2.1.3 How to Send Command
Requests Using the USB Connection**. For information about receiving unsolicited
data from the device, see section **2.1.4 How to Receive Data Using the USB
Connection (HID Only)**.

### How to Connect to a Device Using the USB Connection

The steps for a host to connect to the device using the USB connector are the
same as connecting to any USB HID device, and are platform specific. The general
steps regardless of platform are as follows:

-   Enumerate the USB devices connected to the host.
-   Locate the desired device by PID.
-   Open the USB connection.
-   Read the report descriptor.
-   Begin listening for incoming reports, and sending data using outgoing
    reports.

### How to Send Command Requests Using the USB Connection

MMS communication between the host and the device consists of **Messages**,
which are independent of connection type and are documented in section **2.7**.
This section focuses specifically on how to use the device’s USB HID connection
to transmit a **Command** to the host by composing and sending a **Request
Message**, then listening for and interpreting the corresponding **Response
Message**.

When the device is connected to the host via USB, the host sends one or more
**Output Reports** to the device to send the requests for commands, and listens
/ waits for the device to send one or more **Input Reports** containing a
response (see section **2.1.1**). All reports use Usage Page **0xFF00**, Usage
ID **0x20**, and no Report ID (which some platform libraries present to the
calling software as Report ID 0x00).

The host may send Output Reports by using either the default **Control** pipe or
the Interrupt OUT pipe using a blocking call to the platform’s USB libraries.
The device ACKs all Output Reports immediately. Upon detecting the ACK for the
last Output Report in the message stream, the host software can immediately
begin listening for one or more follow-up Input Reports containing the device’s
response.

Some messages defined in section **2.7** may exceed the maximum packet length
allowed by USB HID. For this reason, MMS implements a packetizing scheme the
host must use when it composes Output Reports to send commands, and when it
decomposes Input Reports to receive responses. The host should follow this
general sequence to send a request and receive a response:

1.  Choose the command to invoke from section **6 Commands**.
2.  Construct the command request message using the **Request** table in the
    command documentation. For a deeper explanation of the contents of request
    tables, see section **2.7**.
3.  .
4.  Determine the complete length of the command request message.
5.  Examine the device’s **Report Descriptor** to determine what payload length
    the device expects for an Output Report (operating system libraries may
    refer to this length as the “Report Length” or “Report Count”). MMS devices
    using USB HID generally use a payload length of 64 bytes.
    1.  If the message length fits the **Single Packet** payload length of 62
        bytes, wrap the message in the Single Packet format shown in **Table
        4**.
    2.  If the message length does not fit the Single Packet payload length,
        wrap the message in the format of a single **Multi-Packet Head**,
        followed by zero or more **Multi-Packet Middles** as necessary, followed
        by one **Multi-Packet Tail**, as shown in **Table 5**, **Table 6**, and
        **Table 7**. If necessary, the host can cancel in the middle of a
        Multi-Packet message using the **Multi-Packet Cancel** packet shown in
        **Table 8**.
6.  For each packet, send an Output Report to the device, and wait for the
    device to ACK the output report USB packet. Upon ACK, either send the next
    packet in the sequence (if any), or begin listening for an Input Report
    containing the device’s response message [see section **2.1.4 How to Receive
    Data Using the USB Connection (HID Only)**]. If an ACK does not arrive, time
    out and assume the command needs to be started again.
7.  Strip wrappers off the device’s response in exactly the same way you
    constructed the command (using either Single Packet format or Multi-Packet
    format), and recompose the response message. Be sure to assemble the packets
    in the correct order using **Packet Number**, and to truncate the padding
    based on **Message Length** or **Remaining Message Length**.
8.  Parse the final response message using the Response table in the
    documentation for the command.

### How to Receive Data Using the USB Connection (HID Only)

MMS devices use the same mechanism to send **Response** messages to host
commands and to send unsolicited **Notifications** to the host when events
occur, such as device state changes or user interactions.

When the device communicates with the host as a vendor-defined HID device, it
sends messages to the host via an Input Report, which it sends to the host using
the **USB Interrupt IN** pipe. Per the USB HID standard, the host polls the
device on a regular Polling Interval to see if the device has input reports
available to send. If the device does not, it responds to the host’s poll with a
USB NAK.

The host software should always be listening for **Input Reports** from the
device containing notification messages and command response messages.
Assembling and parsing the incoming message is the same in both cases, but
notification messages, which are generally unpredictable, need to be routed to
different handlers than responses, which are generally anticipated after sending
a command. All input reports use Usage Page **0xFF00**, Usage ID **0x20**.
Because MMS devices only implement one input report, the input report they send
to the host does not include an Input Report ID (which some operating system
libraries present to the calling software as Input Report ID 0x00), in
accordance with the USB HID specification.

Some response and notification messages defined in section **2.7** may exceed
the maximum packet length allowed by USB HID. If the message can’t fit into one
packet, the device sends multiple packets, each containing partial message data
using the same message packet structures described in section **2.1.3**, **Table
4**, **Table 5**, **Table 6**, **Table 7**, **Table 8**.

Upon receiving an input report, the host can determine the size of message
packet Input Reports by looking at the HID report descriptor. The host can
locate a specific data element in the report by finding the corresponding Usage
and interpreting its contents as binary data. Because MMS devices use a single
usage to hold the Input Report contents, unlike devices that divide the Input
Report contents into length-delimited Usages, the host software can hard-code
its method of finding the packet data; it is not necessary for the host software
to examine the Report Descriptor for information about separate data elements’
offsets upon receiving a packet.

The host should follow this general sequence to process incoming Input Reports:

1.  Register a listener with the operating system USB library to have the
    relevant Input Reports routed to the host software for processing.
2.  When an Input Report arrives, knowing from section **2.1.1** that the device
    uses **Usage Page 0xFF00**, and knowing the desired data is found in the
    usage with **Usage ID 0x0020**, call the platform’s USB SDK to retrieve the
    data from **Usage 0xFF000020** in the input report.
3.  Interpret the blob of data according to tables in section **2.1.3** to
    determine whether the incoming message is in single packet format or
    multi-packet format. If it is using multi-packet format:
    1.  Continue buffering the message and processing incoming packets until the
        last packet of the message arrives.
    2.  Assemble the full message. Be sure to assemble the packets in the
        correct order using the Packet Number, and to truncate the padding based
        on **Message Length** or **Remaining Message Length**.
4.  Determine the message type and message ID and parse it according to the
    corresponding Response table or Notification table in section **2.7**.
5.  Route the fully composed message to the appropriate handler.

## How to Use Wireless LAN (WLAN) Connections (WLAN Only)

### About Wireless LAN (WLAN) Connections

This section provides information about developing software for a host to
communicate via a TCP/IP network with MMS products connected to a wireless LAN
access point. In this arrangement, the host and device exchange messages as
peers using the bidirectional **WebSocket** protocol. For details about the
WebSocket Protocol, formally **IETF RFC 6455**, see
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455> and <http://websocket.org>.

For information about SDKs and sample code that can wrap the protocol and speed
up development, see section **1.4 About SDKs and Sample Code**.

### How to Connect to a Device Using the Wireless LAN (WLAN) Connection

Before the device and host can communicate using the wireless LAN (WLAN)
connection, the device must first be configured to connect to a WLAN access
point. For details about configuring the device, see the device’s **Installation
and Operation Manual** or supporting documentation included with the device.

After the device has been successfully configured for WLAN communication,
whenever the device powers on or resets, it attempts to connect to the
configured access point. If it is configured to use DHCP, it contacts a DHCP
server to acquire a dynamic IP address and register its Hostname to the DNS
server, otherwise it uses its configured static IP address. It then opens a
WebSocket server listener port, and waits for a host to establish a connection
using a WebSocket handshake. If any notification events occur before the host
completes the handshake and establishes a connection, the device does not send
the corresponding notifications, and it does not buffer while it waits for a
host to establish a connection.

If you wish to test the device’s network connection before writing any code, you
may choose to use the echo tool at <https://www.websocket.org/echo.html>, which
allows a WebSocket capable browser to connect directly to a local IP address and
port to perform a simple echo operation.

To connect to the device, the host software must follow these steps:

1.  Know the WebSocket connection / handshake parameters:
    1.  /host/ is the device’s IP address or IP name (if DNS is in use). By
        default, when using DHCP, the device registers its Hostname as its IP
        name. Suggest using the Hostname df-device serial number to keep each
        server unique. See the serial number label on the back of the device.
    2.  /port/ is the port the device’s WebSocket server is listening on. Per
        the WebSocket standard, if the host does not specify a port, the
        connection assumes the default (port 80 for non-secure WebSocket, port
        443 for secure WebSocket). For these devices, use the default port.
    3.  /resource name/, /protocols/, and /extensions/ are not required because
        the device only communicates with a single host and uses binary
        WebSocket frames.
    4.  /origin/ is not required per the WebSocket standard, because the host
        software is not a web browser.
    5.  /secure/ is recommended .
2.  As a WebSocket server, the device can be configured to accept up to four
    client connections at a time.
3.  Establish a connection using a standard WebSocket handshake.
4.  Leave the connection open to listen for incoming WebSocket messages as
    binary WebSocket frames.
5.  The device will automatically disconnect from the client at the end of a
    session. See **Command 0x1F03 - Extend Session (Session Management Only)**
    for more details.
6.  Spawn a process to send a WebSocket **ping** across the connection on a
    reasonable interval (such as 5 seconds) to make sure the connection is still
    alive. Note that WebSocket protocol keeps ping / pong and binary message
    traffic separate, so there is not a risk of collision between MMS messages
    and a ping. Upon detecting the connection is no longer functioning (such as
    during power interruptions, wireless interference or out-of-range, network
    outage, etc.), take appropriate action such as:
    1.  Resetting the state of all host-side operations in process
    2.  Reporting the connection state and recommended troubleshooting
        procedures to the operator
    3.  Attempting to re-establish the connection

### How to Send Commands Using the Wireless LAN (WLAN) Connection

To send a command to the device using the WLAN connection:

1.  Make sure there is an open WebSocket connection. See section **2.2.2 How to
    Connect to a Device Using the Wireless LAN (**WLAN) Connection for details.
2.  Choose the command to invoke from section **6 Commands**.
3.  Construct the command request message using the **Request** table in the
    command documentation. For a deeper explanation of the contents of request
    tables, see section **2.7**.
4.  Transmit the full command request using the binary WebSocket message type
    (binary frames).
5.  Listen for the device’s response, which will also come in as a binary
    WebSocket message type.
6.  Make sure the incoming message is the expected response, not an asynchronous
    notification.
7.  Parse the final response message using the Response table in the
    documentation for the command.

### How to Receive Data Using the Wireless LAN (WLAN) Connection

MMS devices use the same mechanism to send **Response** messages to host
commands and to send unsolicited **Notifications** to the host when events
occur, such as device state changes or user interactions.

The host software should always be listening for notification messages, and
should listen for command response messages after sending a command. Receiving
the incoming message is the same in both cases, but notification messages, which
are generally unpredictable, need to be routed to different handlers than
responses, which are generally anticipated after sending a command.

The host should follow this general sequence to process notification messages
incoming via WebSocket protocol:

1.  Make sure there is an open WebSocket connection. See section **2.2.2 How to
    Connect to a Device Using the Wireless LAN (**WLAN) Connection for details.
2.  After a WebSocket message arrives, determine the message type and message ID
    and route / parse it according to the corresponding Response table or
    Notification table in section **2.7**.

## How to Use Bluetooth® LE Connections (Bluetooth® LE Only)

This section provides information about developing software for a Bluetooth®
LE-capable host that needs to communicate with the device using Bluetooth® Low
Energy (Bluetooth® LE). The device acts as a Bluetooth® LE server/peripheral,
and the host acts as a client/central.

### About GATT Characteristics

Messages are exchanged with the device using a service named “DynaFlex”. The
UUID for this service is 0c ba 14 b7 ff 24 47 b0 be 09 26 44 05 38 53 0c in big
endian order. This service contains the following characteristics.

Messages are sent to the device using a characteristic named “Message From
Host”. The UUID for this service is 47 f0 5f fa 59 09 49 69 bc 57 25 0d 47 e8 74
e5 in big endian order. This characteristic supports the Write Request Attribute
PDU Method. The value of this characteristic has a variable length. The maximum
length is 244 bytes. The host must have performed secure connections pairing
with the device before the device will allow it to write to this characteristic.

Messages are sent to the host using a characteristic named “Message To Host”.
The UUID for this service is fe d4 91 18 c7 e2 4a 61 9e d5 e6 dd 65 c3 07 1b in
big endian order. This characteristic only supports the Handle Value
Notification Attribute PDU Method. The value of this characteristic has a
variable length. The maximum length is 244 bytes. The host must have secure
connections pairing with the device before the device will send notifications on
this characteristic. The host must also enable notifications to be sent from
this characteristic before the device will start sending messages on it.

Messages are exchanged with these characteristics using the DynaFlex Bluetooth®
LE protocol. This protocol is described in the next section.

### DynaFlex Bluetooth® LE protocol

This protocol was designed to meet the following goals.

1.  Exchange messages with the device.
2.  Maximize throughput.
3.  Allow the side receiving a message to detect if a message is partially or
    completely dropped.

Bluetooth® LE attribute protocol transmits data in protocol data units (PDUs).
The maximum size of a PDU is determined by the maximum transmission unit (MTU)
agreed on between the host and the device. The MTU is typically set to the
minimum of the host and device’s ATT_MTU size. DynaFlex’s ATT_MTU size is 247
bytes. Most host’s ATT_MTU sizes are larger than 247 bytes, so the MTU size
agreed on between most hosts and DynaFlex’s is 247 bytes. Since application
messages can be much larger than 247 bytes, application messages need to be able
to be sent using multiple PDUs. Note that the minimum ATT_MTU allowed for all
hosts and devices is 23 bytes. To maximize throughput, all messages should be
sent using the maximum MTU size possible. This protocol allows large application
messages to be sent using multiple PDUs. The protocol format for sending and
receiving messages is the same for both the host and device. The only difference
is the characteristic used. Since the attribute opcode and attribute handle use
3 bytes of the MTU size the attribute value length for the message from host and
message to host characteristics is limited to 247 - 3 = 244 bytes.

When a PDU is received in the application layer, it is guaranteed to be correct
since Bluetooth® LE does error detection and retries in the lower layers.
However, PDUs can be completely dropped if the device goes out of range of the
host or bad interference occurs. So host applications should be written with
appropriate error detection and handling to account for these potential drops.

The following is the definition of each byte of a characteristic’s value for the
DynaFlex Bluetooth® LE protocol:

The first byte of the characteristic value is the message counter for every PDU.
The message counter should be zero for the first message sent after every new
BLE connection is established and should increase by one after sending every
message. If its’ value is 0xff before it increments, it should have a value of
zero after incrementing. All PDUs of a single message should have the same value
for the message counter. The side receiving the message can use this counter to
help detect if some PDUs of a message or if an entire message is dropped. The
message counter for the message from host direction should be completely
independent from the message counter for the message to host direction.

The second byte of the characteristic value is the PDU counter for every PDU.
The PDU counter should be zero for the first PDU of a message sent and should
increase by one after sending every PDU of that message. If its’ value is 0xff
before it increments, it should have a value of one instead of zero after
incrementing. This is because the value of zero is reserved to always be used
for the first PDU of a message. If the device receives a PDU counter of zero
while it is still expecting more PDUs for an existing message, it shall discard
any message that it is currently receiving and start receiving the new message.
The first PDU of a message has a different protocol format than the remaining
PDUs. The side receiving the message shall use this counter to help detect if
some PDUs of a message are dropped. The PDU counter for the message from host
direction should be completely independent from the PDU counter for the message
to host direction.

If the PDU counter is zero indicating that this is the first PDU of a message,
then the following paragraphs define the remaining bytes of the PDU, otherwise
the remaining bytes of the PDU starting with the third byte contain the next
portion of the application message.

If the PDU counter is zero indicating that this is the first PDU of a message,
then the third byte of the PDU contains the protocol control byte (PCB). The
protocol control byte is reserved and should always be set to zero. This byte
may be used in the future to extend the protocol.

If the PDU counter is zero indicating that this is the first PDU of a message,
then the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh byte of the PDU contain the message
length in big endian order. This is the length of the entire message not just
the portion contained in the current PDU. The receiver of the message shall use
this value to determine when it has received all the PDUs of a message.

If the PDU counter is zero indicating that this is the first PDU of a message,
the remaining bytes of the PDU starting with the eighth byte contain the first
portion of the application message. If the entire application message fits into
one PDU then it contains all the application message.

The following is an example of sending two application messages in a row where
the first 9-byte message fits into a single PDU and the second 512-byte message
requires 3 PDUs.

| Message Counter | PDU Counter | PCB | Message Length | Message Portion |
|-----------------|-------------|-----|----------------|-----------------|
| 00              | 00          | 00  | 00 00 00 09    | 9 bytes         |

| Message Counter | PDU Counter | PCB | Message Length          | Message Portion |
|-----------------|-------------|-----|-------------------------|-----------------|
| 01              | 00          | 00  | 00 00 02 00 (512 bytes) | 237 bytes       |

| Message Counter | PDU Counter | Message Portion |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 01              | 01          | 242 bytes       |

| Message Counter | PDU Counter | Message Portion |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 01              | 02          | 33 bytes        |

Protocol implementation recommendations:

1.  To optimize throughput, split large messages into the minimum number of PDUs
    by making all PDUs the agreed upon MTU size long (ideally 247 bytes) except
    for possibly the last PDU.
2.  Implement error detection that as a minimum detects and discards incomplete
    messages.
3.  If the device detects an incomplete message, it should be able to continue
    to receive new complete messages.
4.  Use the message counter, PDU counter and message length fields to detect
    incomplete messages.
5.  When receiving a multiple PDU message and expecting more PDUs, if the next
    PDU has a PDU counter of zero discard the previous message and start
    receiving the new one.
6.  When looking for the first PDU of a message, if a PDU arrives that does not
    have a PDU counter of zero discard it.
7.  If the message counter advances by more than one between two messages,
    assume a message has been dropped. The device should ignore this situation.
    The host can ignore this situation too or implement error handling of its
    choice.

## How to Use RS-232/UART Connections (SLIP Only)

To connect the host to the device using a serial connection such as RS-232 UART,
configure the host’s serial port to use 115200 Baud, 8 Bit, No-parity,1 Stop
bit, and No flow control.

When using these connections, the host and device use SLIP format to send and
receive MMS messages. For details, see section **2.6 How to Use SLIP Format
(SLIP Only)**. The host software should always be ready to receive notification
messages and command response messages from the device.

(BCR Only) When using the UART interface and the device is configured to be
enable user action event notifications using **Property 1.2.7.1.2.1 User Event
Notification Controls Enable**, the device cannot determine if it is connected
to a host or not, therefore the device will continue reading barcode data even
when not connected to a host.

## How to Use SLIP Format (SLIP Only)

For connection types that do not include error detection and correction, such as
serial protocols, which provides a means for the host and device to
re-synchronize in the case of connection errors by watching for specifically
reserved frame delimiters marking the start and end of a message. The MMS SLIP
wrapper is defined in **Table 9**.

All messages start with SLIP’s frame delimiter **C0**, and must consider SLIP
escape sequences that deal with occurrences of C0 inside the SLIP data frame:

-   If an outbound message contains the byte value **C0**, software should
    encode it into SLIP as **DB DC**.
-   If an inbound message contains the byte sequence **DB DC**, software should
    decode it to **C0**.
-   If an outbound message contains the byte value **DB**, software should
    encode it into SLIP as **DB DD**.
-   If an inbound message contains the byte sequence **DB DD**, software should
    decode it to **DB**.

**Message Info** indicates the direction of the message (such as **Direction
Host to Device** for **Commands**, **Direction Device to Host** for
**Notifications**). If the host has sent the device a command that exceeds the
device’s incoming message buffer capacity, the device responds with a brief
message indicating **Hardware Capability Exceeded**, and populates **Length of
MMS Message** with the maximum possible message length the device can process,

## How to Use Apple iAP2 Connections (iAP2 Only)

This section provides information about developing an iOS app that interfaces
with the device via the USB connector using iPod Accessory Protocol (iAP2). For
sample code and other supporting materials, see **1000007353 MAGTEK UNIVERSAL
SDK FOR MMS DEVICES ( iOS )**, available from MagTek.

To develop host software for an iOS host that connects to the device, you must
know the following device properties, which are specified by the purchaser when
ordering, and loaded by the manufacturer:

-   Apple iAP2 AppBundleID, also known as the SDK Protocol, usually in the form
    of a reverse DNS string unique to the host software developer or the device
    purchaser.

The host software should initiate a connection to the device using the iOS SDK’s
**ExternalAccessory** Framework (for sample code, see Apple’s **EADemo** app).
Upon establishing the connection, the host can begin exchanging data with the
device.

# Messages (Requests, Responses, Notifications, and Files)

This section describes the general format of messages exchanged between hosts
and devices that are using the common MMS message framework.

Documentation about the specific messages supported by a given device is
provided in section **6 Commands**.

## About Messages

The host and the device communicate with each other by exchanging blocks of data
called **Messages**, which are standardized wrappers containing a **payload**
that is either a command **Request**, a command **Response**, an unsolicited
**Notification**, or a **File**. For example, the host may send a command
**request** message to the device to change a configuration setting, and the
device may send a command **response** message to indicate the command was
successful; when a cardholder inserts a card, the device may send a
**notification** message to the host that a cardholder has initiated a
transaction; the host may send the device a **file** message to load firmware.

Messages can be nested. For example, a top-level secure wrapper request from the
host to the device may contain an encrypted or signed command request for the
device to unpack, validate, and execute.

**Requests and Responses.** Requests and responses are two of the message
payload types the host and device exchange inside messages. The combination of a
message that contains a **request** payload and a message that contains the
corresponding **response** payload is referred to generally in this document as
a **Command**. The device can only service one command request at a time, and
sends each command response within a pre-determined finite amount of time after
receiving the request. After sending a command request, the host must wait until
the device returns a response before sending another request, or until the
request is unanswered after a reasonable host-defined timeout period passes.

**Notifications.** Notifications are a message payload type the host and device
exchange inside messages. The device sends notification messages to the host if
the device’s state changes or if an external event occurs, such as a cardholder
inserting a card. The device can send a notification at any time, and does not
expect a response or any specific action from the host. By default, the device
sends all notifications to the USB interface. To configure the device to send
notifications on additional connections, use **Command 0x1F02 - Set Notification
Subscriptions**.

**Data Files**. Data Files are a message payload type the host and device
exchange inside messages. The device handles them as a stream, in that it begins
storing the payload of the message before it has received the final packet of
the message, allowing for much larger payloads than standard requests. This is
made possible by restricting the function of the message to just transferring a
file, which means restricting the message payload to primitive data only; it
cannot contain composed TLV data objects.

Regardless of connection type, all MMS devices use the same schema for sending
and receiving messages, which is documented in section **3.2 Message Format**.
For information about transmitting and receiving messages using specific
connection types, which involves following connection-specific rules for
breaking messages down into transmittable **Message Streams**, see section **2
Connection Types**.

## Message Format

### Tag-Length-Value (TLV) Encoding

#### About TLV Encoding

All messages exchanged between the host and the device are formatted using the
tag-length-value **Distinguished Encoding Rules** (DER) defined in **ITU-T
X.680\|ISO/IEC 8824-1** and **ITU-T X.690\|ISO/IEC 8825-1**. A subset of these
standards is also used in **EMV Integrated Circuit Card Specifications for
Payment Systems 4.3, Part IV, Annex B Rules for BER-TLV Data Objects**, so the
latter can serve as a useful point of reference, especially for developers who
are familiar with systems that exchange blocks of EMV data.

Summarizing those specifications, each TLV data object follows these basic
rules:

-   The DER standard designates the least significant bit of a byte as **bit
    1**, and the most significant bit of a byte as **bit 8**. This is different
    from the remainder of the MMS standard, which indexes bit numbers starting
    at 0 to be consistent with each bit position number representing that bit’s
    power of 2.
-   The **Tag** or **Identifier** portion of a TLV data object identifies the
    TLV data object. This standard assigns the **tag** (identifier) portion of
    TLV data objects according to the DER format as follows:
    -   Bits 8 and 7 specify whether the TLV data object is universal,
        application-defined, context-specific, or private. Most messages in this
        standard contain **context-specific** tags (bits 8 and 7 = **10**),
        meaning different messages reuse the same tags, and the tags represent
        sequentially numbered parameters passed in any message. The contents of
        each context-specific tag (parameter) are described for each message in
        section **6 Commands**.
    -   Bit 6 specifies whether the tag is **primitive** (bit 6=**0**), meaning
        it contains its values directly, or **constructed** (bit 6=**1**),
        meaning the TLV data object contains more TLV data objects.
    -   Bits 5 to 1 specify a unique tag number, with 11111 reserved to mean:
        -   The tag is not a single byte long
        -   Bits 7 to 1 of subsequent bytes with bit 8 set to 1 are also part of
            the tag identifier with the most significant of the whole tag number
            in bit 7
        -   Bits 7 to 1 of the final byte with bit 8 set to 0 is also part of
            the tag identifier
-   The **Length** portion is calculated as the total length of the Data portion
    that follows it: Lengths can be either short form or long form:
    -   **Short form** means the length is one byte long in the range 0x00 to
        0x7F.
    -   **Long form** means the length is multiple bytes long, starting with
        one-byte 0x80 or greater, where the lower 7 bits specify how many
        subsequent bytes are used to indicate the length. For example, in the
        case of length 8201C3, 0x82 is greater than 0x7F, and the lower 7 bits
        equal 0x02, so the next 2 bytes 0x01C3 give the total length of the data
        block, 451 bytes.
    -   DER format stipulates all TLV data objects should be encoded using the
        smallest length required to fit the data.
-   The **Value** or **Data** portion is the actual payload of the TLV data
    object.

This document provides message definitions in hexadecimal format; when the host
constructs or interprets a message, if no additional encode / decode filtering
or translation is in place at the platform layer, it should expect each
hexadecimal value shown in this document to be represented as binary bytes in
the message stream, not as string literals. For example, FF is a single byte
with all bits set to 1, not the two-byte string literal “FF.”

#### TLV Example

Below is a brief example of a TLV-encoded request and response for **Command
0xDF01 - Echo**, wrapped in the standard message format documented in section
**3.2.2 Message Structure**.

The host sends the device a binary byte stream
AA0081040101DF018407DF018103010203, which breaks down as follows:

-   AA00 = Standard **Start of Message** / **API Framework Version** (not TLV)
-   81, 04, 0101DF01
    -   Tag 81 = Request Message Parameter 1, **Message Information**
    -   Length 04
    -   Value 0101DF01
        -   01 = Request from host to device
        -   01 = Message reference number
        -   DF01 = **Command 0xDF01 - Echo**
-   84, 07, DF018103010203
    -   Tag 84 = Request Message Parameter 4, **Request Payload**
    -   Length 07
    -   Value DF018103010203
        -   DF01 = Payload format is for Request **Command 0xDF01 - Echo** (not
            TLV)
        -   Tag 81 = Payload Parameter 1, **Value to Echo**
        -   Length 03
        -   Value 010203 = Value to Echo 010203

In response, the device sends the host a binary byte stream
AA0081048201DF018204000000008407DF018103010203, which breaks down as follows:

-   AA00 = Standard **Start of Message** / **API Framework Version** (not TLV)
-   81, 04, 8201DF01
    -   Tag 81 = Response Message Parameter 1, **Message Information**
    -   Length 04
    -   Value 8201DF01
        -   82 = Response from device to host
        -   01 = Message reference number
        -   DF01 = **Command 0xDF01 - Echo**
-   82, 04, 00000000
    -   Tag 82 = Response Message Parameter 2, **Response Status** (one byte
        **Operation Status Summary**, three bytes **Operation Status Detail**)
    -   Length 04
    -   Value 00, 000000 = OK / Done, General / All Good / Requested operation
        was successful
-   84, 07, DF018103010203
    -   Tag 84 = Response Message Parameter 4 for **Response Payload**
    -   Length 07
    -   Value DF018103010203
        -   DF01 = Payload format is for Response **Command 0xDF01 - Echo** (not
            TLV)
        -   Tag 81 = Payload Parameter 1, **Value to Echo**
        -   Length 03
        -   Value 010203 = Value to Echo 010203

#### How to Read TLV Tables

Throughout this document, tables that show TLV data objects use some number of
slashes in front of the **Tag** identifier to indicate that object’s *relative*
level of nesting / containment within other TLV data objects *in the same
table*. These levels should not be assumed to be absolute levels, because a
given TLV data object may be nested within other TLV data objects at any level.
The slash notation saves table space compared to whitespace indenting and is
easier to read than a separate “Nesting Level” column, which can be difficult to
notice.

For example:

-   **Earth** contains
-   **/North America**, which contains
-   **//United States**, which contains
-   **///California**.

Although **Earth** is a *relative* root within the context of the objects above,
it is not an *absolute* root, because the nested objects starting with the
**Earth** relative root could be wrapped inside another object representing
**Sol Solar System**, and that could be wrapped in **Milky Way Galaxy**, and so
on.

In tables that show TLV data objects, a Length of **var** means the length is
variable, and the device or host must calculate it based on whatever is nested
inside the TLV data object.

See **Table 10 below** for an example.

Table 10 - TLV Table Example

A1/82 is optional (Req = **O**), so the length of A1 will vary depending on whether or not A1/82 is included (Len = **var**) or excluded / left implicit.                       | T   | R   |          |
| /81    | 01  | TLV data object A1/81 contains one byte and is required. It has no default value because it must be explicitly included.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | B   | R   |          |
| /82    | 03  | TLV data object A1/82 contains three bytes but is optional. If it is not included in this object, the device (or host) assumes the default value 0x4D6F6D.                                                                                                                                                                             | B   | O   | 0x4D6F6D |
| /A3    | 08  | TLV data object A1/A3 contains two TLV data objects: 81 and 82, or more precisely, A1/A3/81 and A1/A3/82. Its length is the combined length of its two nested objects: 5 bytes for 81 (tag **81**, length **03**, value **xx xx xx**) and 3 bytes for 82 (tag **82**, length **01**, value **xx**).                                    | T   | R   |          |
| //81   | 03  | TLV data object A1/A3/81 contains three bytes and is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | B   | R   |          |

| /84    | 03  | TLV data object A1/84 contains three bytes that represent distinct values, but to save space, they are length-delimited directly inside A1/84, instead of being assigned their own individual nested TLV data objects. The length of A1/84 is simply the combination of three single bytes.                                            | B   | R   |          |
| //null | (1) | This is just a raw byte inside 84. As a simple byte, it has no tag-length-value structure of its own, so its Tag is shown here as **/null**, and its length is in parentheses to indicate it is not encoded as a TLV data object, it is simply a byte count that can be used to “slice apart” the contents of 84 into separate values. | B   | R   |          |
| //null | (1) | This is another byte contained by 84.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | B   | R   |          |

### Message Structure

Each message type follow a specific structure, detailed in the subsections
below.

#### Request Message

One byte standard Start of Message constant, not in TLV format.

-   0xAA = Standard start of message byte

One-byte standard API Framework Version constant, not in TLV format, used for
tracking version compatibility. Devices that implement higher (newer) versions
of the API framework are designed to be reasonably compatible with current and
previous (lower) versions:

-   0x00 = Pre-production development (limited breaking changes). At minimum,
    every device MagTek ever produces using the MMS framework will accept this
    value.
-   0x01 = First Production release (no breaking changes)
-   0x02 = Second Production release
-   Etc.

| /null | (1)   | Message Reference Number The host can use any value in this byte to help match responses with their corresponding requests. The device includes the same number in the corresponding response(s). MagTek recommends using a simple incrementing counter per request the host sends during a session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | B   | R   |         |
| /null | (2)   | Command ID The fully qualified Command number as defined in section **6 Commands**. The first byte is the Command Group number, which groups functionally related requests, and the second byte is the Command number within that group. If the **Request Payload** in the message contains wrappers, the host should specify the command it is invoking at the core of the request after all wrappers have been removed. This value is included primarily for performance and key conservation; the device simply uses it to make sure it is in a mode where it is capable of processing the desired command before it begins processing the **Request Payload**. | B   | R   |         |

#### Response Message

One byte standard Start of Message constant, not in TLV format.

-   0xAA = Standard start of message byte

One-byte standard API Framework Version constant, not in TLV format, used for
tracking version compatibility. Devices that implement higher (newer) versions
of the API framework are designed to be reasonably compatible with current and
previous (lower) versions:

-   0x00 = Pre-production development (limited breaking changes). At minimum,
    every device MagTek ever produces using the MMS framework will accept this
    value.
-   0x01 = First Production release (no breaking changes)
-   0x02 = Second Production release
-   Etc.

# Data Types and Shared TLV Data Objects

This section describes the primitive and composed data types referred to
throughout this document.

## Primitive Data Types

TLV data objects use the following primitive data types:

-   A = Alphabetic (string, no numbers).
-   AN = Alphanumeric (string).
-   B = Binary value, which includes bit combinations (“OR” types).
-   CN = Compressed numeric, as defined by **EMV 4.3 Book 3**, section **Data
    Element Format Conventions**.
-   N = Numeric, as defined by **EMV 4.3 Book 3**, section **Data Element Format
    Conventions**.
-   T = TLV **Constructed** data object (TLV Value contains additional layers of
    TLV-encoded data the parser should continue to process).

## About Track Data

After the host receives and decrypts **EMV ARQC Type** data or **Merchant Data
Container** data from the device, it may need to parse each track into
individual values embedded in the tracks. The device can read multiple card
formats, which vary even between different issuers and payment brands using the
same underlying standards. Describing all possible formats is beyond the scope
of this document, but this section describes how to parse data from tracks 1, 2,
and 3 in a generic ISO/ABA compliant format as an example.

**Table 17** shows an example of ISO/ABA track data the device sends to the
host, using unmasked placeholder numbers to make it easier to see the relative
positions of the values embedded in the track data. It is important to note that
some cards do not include Track 3 data. Manually entered data does not include
Track 3.

Table 17 - Example Generic ISO/ABA Track Data Format

| Generic ISO/ABA Track Data Format |                                                             |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Track 1 Data                      | %75555555555555555\^CARDHOLDER NAME/\^33338880004444000006? |
| Track 2 Data                      | ;5555555555555555=33338880004444006?                        |
| Track 3 Data                      | ;5555555555555555=333388800044440000006?                    |

The example track data in **Table 17** can be interpreted as follows:

-   The **%**, **?**, and **;** are Sentinels / delimiters, and are taken
    directly from the data on the card.
-   The **7** at the beginning of Track 1 data is the card format code. For
    swiped credit / debit cards, this comes from the card and is generally
    **B**. Manually entered data uses **M**.
-   The string of **5**s is the Account Number / License Number / PAN.
-   The carets **\^** are a standard ISO track 1 delimiter surrounding the
    Cardholder Name.
-   **CARDHOLDER NAME/** is the Cardholder Name. Manually entered data uses
    string literal **MANUAL ENTRY/**.
-   The string of **3**s is the Expiration Date (YYMM).
-   The string of **8**s is the Service Code. For swiped credit / debit cards,
    this comes from the card. Manually entered data uses **000**.
-   The remaining characters (**0**s, **4**s, and **6**) are Discretionary Data.
    For swiped debit / credit cards this data is of varying length and content
    and comes from the card, and must be interpreted according to the standards
    established by issuers, payment brands, and so on. Manually entered track
    data uses a MagTek standard for Discretionary Data as follows:
    -   The string of **4**s is the CVV2 a cardholder or operator entered on the
        keypad. This may be 3 or 4 characters long and is not padded, so the
        host software must find it by using the fixed-length padding and
        sentinels that surround it.
    -   The strings of **0**s are literals of fixed length: Track 1 has three
        zeroes after the Service Code, and five zeroes after the CVV2; Track 2
        has three zeroes after the Service Code, and two zeroes after CVV2.
    -   The **6** contains either a 0 or a 1. This Field Option tells what data
        is included in the track data, where **0 = Acct, Date, CVV** and **1 =
        Name on Card, Acct, Date, CVV**.

## Display Strings

The Display Strings type provides a pre-defined set of messages by string ID
that the host and device use for various user interface features.

## Encryption Type

The Encryption Type provides the key type, variant, and other information the
host can use to decrypt encrypted data included in various payloads. The
possible values are an ORed bitmask using the following elements:

-   0xxx xxxx = Fixed Key (Not used)
-   1xxx xxxx = DUKPT Key
-   xx00 xxxx = TDES
-   xx01 xxxx = AES128
-   xx10 xxxx = AES256
-   xxxx 0000 = Data Encrypt/Decrypt Variant
-   xxxx 0001 = PIN Variant
-   xxxx 0010 = MAC Variant
-   xxxx 0011 = Data, Encrypt Variant
-   xxxx 0100 = MAC Verify Variant
-   xxxx 0101 = RESERVED
-   xxxx 0110 = RESERVED
-   xxxx 0111 = AES PIN Encrypt
-   xxxx 1000 = AES MAC Generate
-   xxxx 1001 = AES MAC Verify
-   xxxx 1010 = AES MAC Generate/Verify
-   xxxx 1011 = AES Data Encrypt
-   xxxx 1100 = AES Data Decrypt
-   xxxx 1101 = AES Data Encrypt/Decrypt
-   xxxx 1110 = RESERVED
-   xxxx 1111 = RESERVED

## EMV ARQC Type

The device formats ARQC messages as shown in **Table 19**. The default is an EMV
standard list of ARQC message tags. The host may also customize the contents of
ARQC messages by setting **Property 1.1.1.1.1.2 EMV ARQC Message Tag List**.

### EMV ARQC (DynaPro Format) Type

2-byte MSB message length excluding padding and CBC-MAC

Padding to ensure the length of data, starting with the message length at the
very beginning, and ending with any additional padding, is a multiple of 8 bytes
for TDES, or 16 bytes for AES. This is a requirement of using the CBC-MAC
algorithm.

Four-byte CBC-MAC. The host should calculate the CBC-MAC and verify that it
matches. For details about calculating a CBC-MAC, see About Message
Authentication Codes (MAC).

The device encrypts the value inside the **Encrypted Data Primitive** container
using the **Encrypted Transaction Data Encryption Type** parameter and working
key associated with the keyset number currently active in the device’s
configuration. As a requirement for using DUKPT encryption algorithms, the
device pads it so the length of its value is a multiple of 8 bytes for TDES, or
16 bytes for AES. The device uses container DFDF58 to report how many bytes of
data object DFDF59 are padding. Data object DFDF59 itself is formatted like
**Table 20** after the host decrypts it.

Padding to ensure the length of data, starting with the message length at the
very beginning, and ending with any additional padding, is a multiple of 8 bytes
for TDES, or 16 bytes for AES. This is a requirement of using the CBC-MAC

Padding to ensure the length of data, starting with the message length at the
very beginning, and ending with any additional padding, is a multiple of 8 bytes
for TDES, or 16 bytes for AES. This is a requirement of using the CBC-MAC
algorithm.

## EMV Batch Data Type

The device formats EMV batch data, such as merchant data and pre-defined EMV
batch data tags, using the format shown in **Table 27**. The default is an EMV
standard list of batch data message tags. The host may also customize the
contents of batch data messages by setting **Property 1.1.1.1.1.3 EMV Batch Data
Tag List**.

(EMV Contact Only) For unsuccessful transactions, this data object can contain
additional pre-defined reversal data. It is normally used by the host for data
capture. The default is an EMV standard list of reversal data message tags. The
host may also customize the contents of reversal data messages by setting
**Property 1.1.1.1.1.4 EMV Reversal Data Tag List**.

As part of successful completion of **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction**, this
data structure contains the results of the transaction. The set of tags used
during a given EMV transaction is a combination of the tags defined in the EMV
specification and the tags that are specific to the kernel being used for the
transaction.

Padding to ensure the length of data, starting with the message length at the
very beginning, and ending with any additional padding, is a multiple of 8 bytes
for TDES, or 16 bytes for AES. This is a requirement of using the CBC-MAC
algorithm.

Four-byte CBC-MAC. The host should calculate the CBC-MAC and verify that it
matches. For details about calculating a CBC-MAC, see About Message
Authentication Codes (MAC).

## EMV Terminal Configuration File Type

The host uses **Command 0xD812 - Start Send File to Device (Unsecured)** to load
this file type to control the behavior of the device’s EMV contact kernel. The
configuration loaded using this file type must be designed to work together with
all instances of **EMV Processing Configuration File Type**  and **EMV Entry
Point Configuration File Type**  the host loads into the device.

MagTek provides tools that allow these settings to be loaded using a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet for more convenient authoring, review, and change tracking.
For a reference sample spreadsheet that contains EMVCo approved configurations,
contact MagTek Support Services.

This document shows one example of the available Contact Level 2 certified
configurations (**DynaFlex C01, Merchant, Attended, ODA**). To see which
configurations are supported on the devices you are using, see the list of
**Vendor Config IDs** in the device’s **Letter of Approval for Contact Level 2**
posted in the list of **Approved / Evaluated** products on the EMVCo web site.
For detailed descriptions of the tags included in this file type, including
possible valid values and their effects on device behavior, see **EMV Integrated
Circuit Card Specifications for Payment Systems v4.3**.

## EMV Processing Configuration File Type

The host uses **Command 0xD812 - Start Send File to Device (Unsecured)** to load
this file type to control the behavior of the device’s EMV kernels. The host
must compile a single instance of this file type containing multiple instances
of the **AID Delimiter Container**, one for each contact or contactless AID the
device should support. For each instance of the **AID Delimiter Container**
where tag 9F01 is set to a contactless AID, the host must load a corresponding
instance of an Entry Point Table when it loads the **EMV Entry Point
Configuration File Type** .

## TR-31 Key Block Type

A **TR-31** (**X9.143**) key block consists of three parts:

The **Key Block Header** (KBH) which contains attribute information about the
key and the key block and is not encrypted. It is always treated as ASCII.

-   The first section is 16 bytes with a fixed format defined below.
-   The second section is optional within the standard, but required for current
    products.

The **Confidential Data**, which is encrypted and always binary.

-   Two bytes indicating the key length (in bits, AES-128 is 128 bits, so length
    will be 0080).
-   The secret key and/or sensitive data.
-   Padding as required (random bytes 0x00 to 0xFF).

The **MAC**, which is of varying length as follows:

-   64 bits if the TDEA key derivation method is used (typically not used for
    this device).
-   128 bits if the AES key derivation method is used.

![A black and white text on a black and white background AI-generated content
may be incorrect.](Images/dbdf5e334fccf6cc5ccb3ff26ae15b31.png)

Symmetric keys are padded with **Block Padding** to the maximum length for the
algorithm, 192 bits for TDEA or 256 bits for AES, to hide the true length of
short keys.

The data to be encrypted and the MAC are always binary for calculation purposes.
The encrypted data and the MAC are converted to ASCII hex as the last step.

Date and time strings specified within the TR-31 block are represented according
to the rules described in **ISO 8601** and **TR-31**. Year is 4 digits. Time
uses UTC 24 hour clock. Some functions like ‘toISOString()’ will produce a
string of format **yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.fffZ** where fff is a decimal fraction of
a second, Z is UTC time zone. The device ignores ‘Z’ and ‘.fff’ if they are
present. Seconds ‘:ss’ are optional. Date, hours, and minutes are required. For
example, March 23, 2020 4:19PM is encoded as **2020-03-23T16:19** at minimum,
but could also be **2020-03-23T16:19:00.000Z**.

### DUKPT Key Mapping

#### Terms and Definitions

**DUKPT –** Derived Unique Key Per Transaction

**OID** – Object Identifier

**SRED** - Secure Reading and Exchange of Data

There are 7 new OIDs defined for these 7 SRED Data IDs.

Each OID value contains a two-byte DUKPT slot ID and a one-byte transformation
ID.

Table 59 - SRED Data IDs and OIDs

| **SRED Data ID**                                   | **OID**        | **OID Size** |

| **Data Type** | User Data (RFU) | Token (RFU) | Magneprint | MAC   | Account Data | PIN   |

During TR31 Key Injection, each DUKPT Slot ID contains a parameter indicates the
purpose of a Key Set.

Example 1: The restriction value is 0x3F

This Key Set can be used for all purposes.

Example 2: The restriction value is 0x3E

This Key Set can be used for all purposes, except PIN Encryption.

Example 3: The restriction value is 0x01

This Key Set can be used for PIN Encryption only.

### The Rules of Key Mapping

SRED Data ID map configuration values (Slot ID and Transformation ID) must be
checked and rejected if they don’t meet the following conditions.

a). The DUKPT Slot ID must be loaded. (**Table 62**)

b). The loaded DUKPT Slot ID must allows this type of SRED Data ID. (Table
61**)**

c). The transformation must be allowed by **Table 63**.

### The settings of DUKPT Slot IDs injected through TR31

Here is the list of parameters of 4 DUKPT Slot IDs based on the existing Key
Injection Tool.

Table 62 - Settings of Injected DUKPT Slot IDs

| DUKPT Slot ID  | Key Type | Restrictions |
|----------------|----------|--------------|
| DKPTM0-2000    | TDES     | 0x3E         |
| DKPTM2-2002    | AES-128  | 0x3F         |
| DKPTM3-2003    | AES-256  | 0x3F         |
| DKPTM7-2007    | TDES     | 0x3F         |

Note: If SRED Data ID 2 and 4 are mapped to the same Key Set, then they must
have the same Transformation ID.

If the Transformation ID of the latest key mapping request is different, then
the original OID setting of the other SRED Data ID will be forced to match the
latest OID setting. For example, SRED Data ID 2 has been mapped to 0x2007 0x04,
user wants to map SRED Data ID 4 to 0x2007 0x05, then the OID setting of SRED
Data ID 2 will be forced to 0x2007 0x05.

#### Examples of Key Mapping

The following OID Values indicate that:

1.  200701: Map PIN-TDES to DKPTM7-2007 PIN Encryption Variant.
2.  20020B: Map Account Data to DKPTM2-2002 Data Encryption Usage.
3.  200702: Map MAC to DKPTM7-2007 MAC Generate/Verify Variant.
4.  20030B: Map MangePrint to DKPTM3-2003 Data Encryption Usage.
5.  000004: MagTek Token is RFU, 0000 ID does not exist (this is default value).
6.  000004: User Data is RFU, 0000 ID does not exist (this is default value).
7.  200207: Map PIN-AES to DKPTM2-2002 PIN Encryption Usage.

## TagsType Type (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY FOR NOW)

The **TagsType** TLV data object is used to contain unstructured lists of
tag/value pairs, for example, for reading or writing the contents of tag
databases used to configure EMV terminal and application settings.

## TLVType Type (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY FOR NOW)

The **TLVType** data object is used to contain structured TLV objects, for
example, for conveying the data used in processing EMV transactions.

## Common File Structure

Some files types conform to the common file structure format that follows.

The following is a list of file types that conform to this format.

1.  EMV file types
2.  **Certificate File Types**
3.  **Certificate Signing Request (CSR) File Types**

Table 67 - Common File Structure

|-----|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|---------|
| C1  | 4   | File Type See Table 201                                                                                | B   | R   | N/A     |
| CE  | var | File Payload See the “File Type” subsections of section **4 Data Types and Shared TLV Data Objects**.  | B   | R   | N/A     |

## Certificate File Types

These file types are listed in Table 201.

These file types conform to the **Common File Structure** format.

The File Payload of these files contain a certificate in PEM format.

Certificates must be loaded into the device in the order of trust starting with
the root CA, next intermediate CA(s) and ending with the leaf (server or client
for example) so that the device can verify the signature of each certificate. If
the certificates are not loaded in order, they will be rejected.

When loading a server cert, the associated key pair must already exist in the
device as the CSR keys or as the existing server or client cert and will be used
to verify that the public key contained in the certificate is correct. If the
keys don’t match the certificate will be rejected. If the certificate is
associated with the CSR keys, the CSR keys will be associated with the
certificate and will no longer be available for other certificates until
re-generated.

Initial server or client certificates can not be loaded until the respective CSR
keys and CSR is generated.

To generate a CSR see **Command 0xEF03 – Generate CSR (WLAN Only)**.

## Certificate Signing Request (CSR) File Types

These file types are listed in Table 201.

These file types conform to the **Common File Structure** format.

The File Payload of these files contain a certificate signing request in PEM
format.

To generate a CSR see **Command 0xEF03 – Generate CSR (WLAN Only)**.

The device will erase the CSR file from volatile memory after the host fetches
it with **Command 0xD821 - Start Get File from Device**. After fetching the CSR,
the keys used to generate the CSR will still exist in non-volatile memory
associated with a CSR and can be used to generate a new CSR if needed.

## UI Configuration File Type (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY, TOUCH ONLY)

The UI configuration file will be in the following 3 file format during it’s
life time:

1.  Text or .csv file.
2.  TLV binary file.
3.  Signed UI configuration file.

The UI Configuration file may contain maximum 300 items (valid String IDs from
0x0000 to 0x012B, and maximum String length is 30 characters).

The MagTek software tool will convert the “Text or .csv file” to the “TLV binary
file”, and then sign the “TLV binary file” into “Signed UI configuration file”.

#### Step 2: Sign the Binary Output File

This signing process is very similar to the Image Signing process.

Assume the Text file name is CFG0006869-100.xxx, then CFG0006869-100 (in ASCII
format) will be placed in the Required String 1. And, CFG0006869 is the part
number, 100 is the revision number.

The Host App may retrieve this information (CFG0006869-100) from OID
0x020102080101.

### Authenticate and Save the signed UI configuration file

**The Device Will Verify the Mini cert in the Signed UI Configuration File as
Follows:**

-   Step \#1: Fetch the Base mini-cert Public Key from the Base mini-cert
    resides in the Boot-0 image.
-   Step \#2: Hash the Signing mini-cert (exclude the Signature TLV) into
    sha_cksum[32], it is a 32-byte array holds the result of SHA-256 operation.
    These Hash operation parameters are derived from the Signing mini-cert in
    the secure header of the signed UI configuration file.
-   Step \#3: Initialize ECDSA context.
-   Step \#4: Load NIST EC Curve P-256 parameters into ECDSA context.
-   Step \#5: Load Base mini-cert Public Key fetched in Step \#1 into ECDSA
    context.
-   Step \#6: Load sha_cksum[32] and signature into ECDSA context. These
    signature validation parameters are derived from the Signing mini-cert in
    the secure header of the signed UI configuration file.
-   Step \#7: Validate the signature per SECG – SEC1 Elliptic Curve
    Cryptography, Version 2.0, Section 4.1.4. (SECG = Standards for Efficient
    Cryptography Group)

**Verify the Signature of the Signed UI Configuration File:**

-   Step \#1: Hash the payload into sha_cksum[32], it is a 32-byte array holds
    the result of SHA-256 operation on the payload. These Hash operation
    parameters are derived from the secure header of the signed UI configuration
    file, such as Signature Algorithm, Payload Offset, Payload Size, and the
    Payload.
-   Step \#2: Verify the contents of sha_cksum[32] from Step \#1 match the
    contents of Payload Hash Checksum in the secure header.
-   Step \#3: Hash the secure header (exclude the signature TLV) into
    sha_cksum[32].
-   Step \#4: Initialize ECDSA context.
-   Step \#5: Load NIST EC Curve P-256 parameters into ECDSA context.
-   Step \#6: Get the UI configuration file Authentication Public Key from the
    Signing mini-cert in the secure header, load this Key into ECDSA context.
-   Step \#7: Get the signature from the secure header, load sha_cksum[32] and
    signature into ECDSA context. These signature validation parameters are
    derived from the secure header of the signed UI configuration file, such as
    Signature Algorithm, Signature Offset, Signature Size, and the Signature.
-   Step \#8: Validate the signature per SECG – SEC1 Elliptic Curve
    Cryptography, Version 2.0, Section 4.1.4. (SECG = Standards for Efficient
    Cryptography Group)

Save the signed UI configuration file and the Part Number and Revision to the
file system.

### Self-Authenticate the Saved UI Configuration File

During power-up, the device will retrieve and authenticate the saved UI
configuration file. The device will read the signed UI configuration file, and
then authenticate the file the same way as described **Step 3: Send the Signed
UI Configuration File to the Device with 0xd812 Command.**

## Card Emulation

### Card Emulation Overview

Card emulation enables a DynaFlex/DynaProx device to simulate a Type 4 smart
card. The emulated card has the following characteristics:

-   Compliance: Card emulation conforms to ISO/IEC 14443 Type-A and NFC Forum
    Type 4 standards.
-   Passive Operation: The emulated card functions in passive mode. The phone is
    responsible for generating the magnetic field required to activate the
    simulated card.
-   Read-Only: The emulated card is read-only and does not support writing.
-   Supported Data Type: Supports the URI (URL) data type.

### Device Compatibility

-   iPhone Support: NFC card reading was introduced on Apple iPhones starting
    with the iPhone 7.
-   Android Support: Android added NFC support in 2012; however, compatibility
    depends on the specific phone model and hardware capabilities. Most Android
    phones released since 2016 support NFC. Verify with the phone’s manufacturer
    to confirm compatibility.
-   Google Pay Indicator: If a phone supports Google Pay, it is likely capable
    of reading NFC tags.

# Security

## About Message Authentication Codes (MAC)

“MAC” is an abbreviation of Message Authentication Code, which is a string of
bytes included in a message that can be used to provide reasonable assurance
that the message originated from a trusted source and has not been modified.

### MACs for EMV Data

This section describes how to calculate MACs for EMV ARQC and EMV Batch Data.

The key and variant used to calculate the MAC is determined by how the  **DUKPT
Key Mapping** is mapped, this can be set-up for TDES or AES mode.

The key used to calculate the MAC is normally the same key used to encrypt the
encrypted data included as part of the same data structure. For TDES MAC, the
key variant is always **Message Authentication, Request or Both Ways**. For AES
MAC, this can be AES-128 or AES-256, the valid usages are: 0x08=MAC Generate,
0x0A=MAC Generate/Verify.

For TDES MAC:

ANSI X9.24-3-2017

The MAC operations follow the CBC procedure described in ISO 16609 Section C.4
using padding method 1 defined in ISO 9797 section 6.1.1.

For AES CMAC:

NIST Special Publication 800-38B

Section 6.2 MAC Generation

The data structure for both EMV ARQC and EMV Batch Data has the following format
related to MACing:

AAAA /\* 2-byte MSB message length excluding padding and CBC-MAC \*/

F9\<len\> /\* container for MAC structure and generic data \*/

DFDF54(MAC KSN)\<len\>\<val\>

DFDF55(MAC Encryption Type)\<len\>\<val\>

DFDF25(IFD Serial Number)\<len\>\<val\>

\<Nested TLV data objects specific to the message\>

\<Padding to force the 2-byte MSB message length plus F9 plus padding to be a
multiple of 8 bytes\>

\<Four byte CBC-MAC of all data starting with the 2-byte MSB message length and
ending with the last byte of padding (if any)\>

## About Key Serial Numbers (KSNs)

The device can use two different types of keys: Triple Data Encryption Standard
(TDES) DUKPT Keys and AES DUKPT Keys. The Key Serial Number (KSN) format is
slightly different depending on which type of key is injected into the key slot
that is being used by the operation being performed or the data being passed.

When the device and host are using TDES keys, the Key Serial Number (KSN) is an
80-bit value. The rightmost 21 bits are the current value of the encryption
counter associated with that key. The leftmost 59 bits are the **Initial KSN**
for that key, which is specified during key injection and is a combination of
the **Key Set ID** that identifies the Base Derivation Key (BDK) injected into
the device during manufacture, and the device’s serial number (DSN); how those
two values are combined into the 59 bit Initial KSN is defined by a convention
the customer defines when architecting the solution, with support from MagTek.
For example, one common scheme is to concatenate a 7 hex digit (28 bit) Key Set
ID, a 7 hex digit (28 bit) Device Serial Number, and a 3 bit **Initial Key Load
Counter** the injecting host increments each time the same key is re-loaded into
the device. In these cases, the key can be referenced by an 8-digit MagTek part
number (“key ID”) consisting of the 7 hex digit Key Set ID plus a trailing “0.”

## About Encryption and Decryption

Some data exchanged between the device and the host is encrypted. This includes
parts of the **EMV ARQC Type** and the **EMV Batch Data Type**. To decrypt this
data, the host must first determine what key to use, then decrypt the data. The
following sections explain each of those steps in detail.

## How to Determine the Key

When the device and the host are using TDES DUKPT key and the device is
encrypting data, the host software must do the following to generate a key (the
“derived key”) to use for decryption:

1.  **Determine the value of the Initial Key loaded into the device**. The
    lookup methods the host software uses depend on the overall solution
    architecture, and are outside the scope of this document. However, most
    solutions do this in one of two ways, both of which use the Initial Key
    Serial Number that arrives with the encrypted data:
    1.  Look up the value of the Base Derivation Key using the Initial KSN
        portion of the current KSN as an index value, then use TDES DUKPT
        algorithms to calculate the value of the Initial Key; or
    2.  Look up the value of the Initial Key directly, using the Initial KSN
        portion of the current KSN as an index value.
2.  **Derive the current key**. Apply TDES DUKPT algorithms to the Initial Key
    value and the encryption counter portion of the KSN that arrives with the
    encrypted data.
3.  **Determine which variant of the current key the device used to encrypt**.
    The variants are defined in **ANS X9.24-1:2009 Annex A**, which programmers
    of host software must be familiar with. Which variant the host should use
    depends on the type of data the host is decrypting. The encrypted portions
    of EMV ARQC and EMV Batch Data both use the *Data Encryption, Request or
    Both Ways* variant.
4.  Use the variant algorithm with the current key to calculate that variant.
5.  Decrypt the data according to the steps in section **5.5 How to Decrypt
    Data**.

## How to Decrypt Data

For EMV ARQC and EMV Batch Data, the device begins by TDES encrypting the first
8 bytes of clear text data. The 8-byte result of this encryption is placed in an
encrypted data buffer. The process continues using the TDES CBC (Cipher Block
Chaining) method with the encrypted 8 bytes XORed with the next 8 bytes of clear
text. That result is placed in next 8 bytes of the encrypted data buffer, and
the device continues until all clear text bytes have been encrypted. If the
final block of clear text contains fewer than 8 bytes, the device pads the end
of the block to make 8 bytes. After the final clear text block is XORed with the
prior 8 bytes of encrypted data, the device encrypts it and places it in the
encrypted data value. No Initial Vector is used in the process.

The host must decrypt the data in 8 byte blocks, ignoring any final unused bytes
in the last block. When a value consists of more than one block, the host should
use the CBC method to decrypt the data by following these steps:

1.  Start decryption on the last block of 8 bytes (call it block N) using the
    key.
2.  XOR the result of the decryption with the next-last block of 8 bytes (block
    N-1).
3.  Repeat until reaching the first block.
4.  Do not XOR the first block with anything.
5.  Concatenate all blocks.
6.  Determine the expected length of the decrypted data. For EMV ARQC and EMV
    Batch Data this information is included as part of the unencrypted data
    structure.
7.  Truncate the end of the decrypted data block to the expected data length,
    which discards the padding at the end.

## 24 Hour Automatic Reset PCI Requirement

Due to Payment Card Industry (PCI) certification requirements, the device must
automatically reset at least once every 24 hours. This is required for security
purposes, so that the device can reinitialize memory and perform a self-test.
Host software developers and potentially end users should be aware of this.

By default, the device will automatically reset 23 hours after it boots up and
it will attempt to send a warning notification message to the host 3 minutes
before the reset occurs.

The default behavior is adjustable. See the following for more information.

**Property 1.2.7.1.1.4 Auto Reset Configuration**

**Property 1.2.7.1.1.3 Device Reset Will Occur Soon Notification Control**

Device Reset Will Occur Soon notification in **Notification 0x1001 - Device
Information Update**

One way the host software could handle receiving a device reset will occur
notification would be as follows.

1.  Cancel any operation that is in process like a transaction if it is unlikely
    to end before the reset.
2.  Optionally send **Command 0x1F01 - Reset Device** instead of waiting for the
    automatic reset to occur.
3.  Re-connect with the device and re-start any operation that was in process.

## Device Lock Feature

The purpose of locking a device is to disable most of the device’s functionality
for use cases that need this extra layer of security. When a device is locked,
it will reject all commands except for a few. This locks the majority of the
device’s functionality. Use of the device lock feature is optional. It is not
required by PCI.

The device lock state can be either unlocked or locked. The device lock state
can be retrieved by getting a property.

The device lock state can be changed by setting a secure property or it can be
changed with a command that requires knowledge of the device lock passcode.

The device can be configured to always have the device lock state set to locked
after a reset or power cycle by setting a property.

If the device has a display and the device is locked, the welcome screen will
display “WELCOME” “Device is Locked”. This screen can be customized.

The device lock passcode can be changed by setting a secure property or it can
be changed with a command that requires knowledge of the current device lock
passcode.

The following commands and properties can be used to manage the device lock
feature:

**Command 0xEF06 – Change Device Lock State**

**Command 0xEF07 – Change Device Lock Passcode**

**Command 0xEF08 – Reset Device Lock Passcode (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY FOR NOW)**

**Property 1.2.3.1.1.2 Custom Idle Page Image Device Locked (Display Only)**

**Property 1.2.5.2.1.1 Device Lock State**

**Property 1.2.5.2.1.2 Device Lock State After Reset**

**Property 1.2.5.2.1.3 Device Lock Passcode**

Only the following commands are allowed when the device lock state is set to
locked:

**Command 0x1F01 - Reset Device**

**Command 0x1F03 - Extend Session (Session Management Only)**

**Command 0x1F04 – Terminate Bluetooth® LE Connection (Bluetooth® LE Only)**

**Command 0xD101 - Get Property**

**Command 0xD112 - Set Property (Secured)**

**Command 0xDF01 - Echo**

**Command 0xE001 - Get Challenge**

**Command 0xEF06 – Change Device Lock State**

**Command 0xEF08 – Reset Device Lock Passcode (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY FOR NOW)**

**Command 0xEF09 – Encrypt User Data**

**Command 0xEEEE - Send Secured Command to Device**

# Commands

## Command Group 0x10nn - Transactions

### Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction

The host uses this command to start a payment transaction.

The sequence of events for transactions with card readers enabled is roughly as
follows.

**(MCE Only)** The sequence for Manual Entry Mode is provided further below.

1.  If the device is configured to enable user action event notifications using
    **Property 1.2.7.1.2.1 User Event Notification Controls Enable**, the
    cardholder may present a card or payment device before the host calls this
    command, and the device sends **Notification 0x1001 - Device Information
    Update** to the host to indicate it should call this command to start a
    transaction.
    1.  **(MSR Only)** In the case where the cardholder has swiped before the
        transaction started, the device temporarily stores the card swipe data
        for the period of time specified by **Property 1.2.7.1.2.2 User Event
        Notification MSR Data Timeout (MSR Only)** to make it available during
        the transaction. Later in this sequence, when the device would
        ordinarily prompt the cardholder to swipe, insert, or tap, the device
        briefly displays the same cardholder prompt, then automatically proceeds
        with the transaction using the temporarily stored card data. The
        cardholder does not have to swipe again.
    2.  **(EMV Contact Only \| EMV Contactless Only)** In the case where the
        cardholder has inserted or tapped before the transaction started, the
        host should call this command as quickly as possible while the card is
        still in the slot, or while the card or contactless payment device is
        still within tap range. The device does not begin contact or contactless
        reads until after the host invokes this command and does not store any
        data from the cardholder action event before the transaction is in
        process.
2.  The host composes a command request in the format below, and sends it to the
    device. It may cancel the transaction in process by calling **Command 0x1008
    \- Cancel Transaction**.
3.  The device sends a response in the format below, and waits for the
    cardholder to present payment using one of the enabled payment technologies.
4.  **(BCR Only)** If the cardholder scans a barcode, the device sends
    **Notification 0x0101 - Transaction Information Update** to report Barcode /
    Barcode Event / Type / Data Attached with the barcode data attached and
    terminates the transaction.
5.  After the cardholder presents payment, the device sends **Notification
    0x0101 - Transaction Information Update** to report the payment technology
    being used / **Card Event**.
6.  **(MSR Only)** If **Property 1.2.1.1.1.1 Device-Driven Fallback Behavior
    (MSR Only)** is configured so the device automatically performs fallback
    operations, it performs them at this time following roughly the same
    sequence of steps as host-driven fallback described below. Device-driven
    fallback occurs at this point in the sequence within one iteration of this
    command, whereas host-driven fallback requires the host to re-send this
    command for each retry attempt.
7.  **(EMV Contact Only)** If the cardholder has inserted a chip card and there
    is more than one application the device and card mutually support:
    1.  **(Display Only)** The device prompts the cardholder to select the
        application to use.
    2.  **(No Display Only)** The device sends **Notification 0x1803 - User
        Interface Host Action Request** to report **Cardholder Selection
        Request**/ **Notification Payload** to prompt the cardholder to select
        the application to use. The host should respond by showing the prompt,
        receiving input from the cardholder, and calling **Command 0x1802 -
        Report Cardholder Selection** to report the selection result to the
        device.
8.  The device sends **Notification 0x0101 - Transaction Information Update** to
    report the payment technology being used / **Data Update / ARQC Update /
    Data Attached**.
9.  If the host specified **Quick Chip Transaction Flow** in the **Transaction
    Flow** parameter:
    1.  The device immediately constructs its own internal ARPC Response, with
        tag 8A set to ‘Z3’ to coordinate the transaction with the card or other
        payment method, and sends the host **Notification 0x0105 - Transaction
        Operation Complete** to report the payment technology being used /
        **Kernel Outcome** / **Quick Chip Deferred** /outcome detail. A
        Transaction Option parameter can be set to display on amount or not.
    2.  **(Display Only)** The device shows the message **REMOVE CARD** to
        notify the cardholder the card can be removed.
    3.  **(No Display only)** The device sends the host **Notification 0x1803 -
        User Interface Host Action Request** to report **Display**/**Display
        Message**/**Data Attached** with message **REMOVE CARD** to notify the
        cardholder the card can be removed.
    4.  The host should then process the ARQC Message data, including replacing
        the default amount with the final transaction amount, and should
        coordinate with the transaction processor to retrieve a final
        transaction result. Because in this case the device is not involved in
        determining the final transaction result, it does not send a
        notification to the host to show **APPROVED** or **DECLINED**.
        1.  **(Display Only)** Instead, the host should call **Command 0x1803 -
            Display Message (Display Only)** to show an appropriate message to
            the cardholder, such as **APPROVED** or **DECLINED**, based on the
            final transaction result.
        2.  **(No Display Only)** Instead, the host should use its local display
            to show an appropriate message to the cardholder, such as
            **APPROVED** or **DECLINED**, based on the final transaction result.
10. If the host specified **EMV Transaction Flow** in the **Transaction Flow**
    parameter:
    1.  The host processes the ARQC Message data and uses it to coordinate with
        the transaction processor to receive an ARPC Response, which it
        processes and sends to the device using **Command 0x1004 - Resume
        Transaction**.
    2.  The device waits for the period of time specified in **Property
        1.1.1.1.1.5 ARPC Receive Timeout**. If an ARPC timeout occurs, the
        device sends the ARQC again based on the setting in **Property
        1.1.1.1.1.6 ARPC Retry Attempts**.
    3.  **(EMV Contact Only)** If the cardholder inserted a contact chip card,
        the device communicates with the card to determine whether to approve or
        decline the transaction.
    4.  The device sends the host **Notification 0x0105 - Transaction Operation
        Complete** to report the payment technology being used / **Kernel
        Outcome** / **Approved** or **Declined** /outcome.
    5.  **(Display Only)** The device shows **APPROVED** or **DECLINED** to
        notify the cardholder of the transaction result.
    6.  **(No Display Only)** The device sends the host **Notification 0x1803 -
        User Interface Host Action Request** to report **Display**/**Display
        Message**/**Data Attached** with message **APPROVED** or **DECLINED** to
        notify the cardholder of the transaction result.
11. **(Touch Only)** If the card requires a signature, and if **Property
    1.2.1.1.2.1 Signature Capture Control** is set to **Device-driven Signature
    Capture**, and if the **Signature Capture Control (MSR Only)** command
    parameter does not apply to the current transaction, the device prompts the
    cardholder to sign.
12. The device sends **Notification 0x0101 - Transaction Information Update** to
    report the payment technology used / **Data Update / Batch Data / Data
    Attached**. **(Touch Only)** Depending on the setting in **Property
    1.2.1.1.2.2 Include Signature Data in EMV Batch Data (Touch Only)**, the
    device includes any acquired signature data with the batch data.
13. The device sends **Notification 0x0105 - Transaction Operation Complete** to
    report the payment technology used / **Outcome** / the final result of the
    transaction.
14. **(MSR Only)** If **Property 1.2.1.1.1.1 Device-Driven Fallback Behavior
    (MSR Only)** is configured so the device does not perform fallback
    operations, and if the solution design requires payment brand fallback
    logic, the host may use the contents of the notifications above to implement
    fallback flow according to the following rules, which mimic the automatic
    fallback behaviors the device implements during a single invocation of this
    command. The primary difference is that the host must keep track of its own
    final **Fallback Indicator** instead of receiving it from the device in the
    **EMV ARQC Type**:
    1.  If the transaction was successful and the notification indicates Payment
        Technology is **EMV Contact** or **EMV Contactless**, there is no need
        to perform fallback-related operations.
    2.  If the transaction was successful and the notification indicates Payment
        Technology is **Magnetic Stripe Reader**, the host should check the
        contents of the **Card Type** tag DFDF52 in the **EMV ARQC Type** from
        the notification. Per payment brand fallback rules:
        1.  If **Card Type** is NOT **MSR Financial and Contact Chip Card
            (ICC)**, the host may continue with the current transaction attempt
            using the magnetic stripe data. There is no need to perform
            fallback-related operations.
        2.  If **Card Type** is **MSR Financial and Contact Chip Card (ICC)**,
            and the host has restarted the same transaction because a previous
            attempt failed with the notification indicating **MSR Fallback**,
            the chip card and the device communicated during the previous
            invocation of this command, and determined they are not compatible.
            The host may continue the current transaction using the magnetic
            stripe data.
        3.  If **Card Type** is **MSR Financial and Contact Chip Card (ICC)**
            and the host has NOT restarted the same transaction three times and
            failed with the notification indicating **Technical Fallback**, the
            card has a chip the cardholder should use so the transaction will be
            more secure. The host should guide the cardholder to use the chip
            card interface by sending **Command 0x1803 - Display Message** to
            direct the device to display **USE CHIP READER**, then repeat
            **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction** and arm the device with the
            contact interface enabled. The host may opt to also arm the
            contactless interface.
        4.  If **Card Type** is **MSR Financial and Contact Chip Card (ICC)**
            and the host has restarted the same transaction three times and
            failed with the notification indicating **Technical Fallback**, the
            host may continue the current transaction using the magnetic stripe
            data.
    3.  If the transaction has failed and the notification indicates Payment
        Technology is **None**, something went wrong at the very beginning of
        the transaction (for example, the host canceled), and the host may
        simply end all attempts at performing the transaction, or it may opt to
        repeat the original transaction with the same payment technologies
        enabled.
    4.  If the transaction has failed and the notification indicates Payment
        Technology is **EMV Contact**, the host should examine the contents of
        the notification. Per payment brand fallback rules:
        1.  If the notification indicates **MSR Fallback**, the chip card and
            the device have communicated and have determined they are not
            compatible. The host should guide the cardholder to use the magnetic
            stripe interface by sending **Command 0x1803 - Display Message** to
            direct the device to display **USE MAGSTRIPE**, then repeat
            **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction** and arm the device with the
            Magnetic Stripe Reader interface enabled. The host may opt to also
            arm the contactless interface.
        2.  If the host has NOT restarted the same transaction three times and
            failed with the notification indicating a **Technical Fallback**,
            the host should guide the cardholder to re-insert the chip card by
            sending **Command 0x1803 - Display Message** to direct the device to
            display **TRY AGAIN**, then repeat **Command 0x1001 - Start
            Transaction** and arm the device with the contact interface enabled.
            The host may opt to also arm the contactless interface.
        3.  If the host has restarted the same transaction three times and
            failed with the notification reporting **Technical Fallback**, the
            host should guide the cardholder to use the magnetic stripe reader
            by sending **Command 0x1803 - Display Message** to direct the device
            to display **USE MAGSTRIPE**, then repeat **Command 0x1001 - Start
            Transaction** and arm the device with the Magnetic Stripe Reader
            interface enabled. The host may opt to also arm the contactless
            interface.
15. (Touch Only) If **Property 1.2.1.1.2.1 Signature Capture Control** is set to
    **Host-driven Signature Capture** and the card requires a signature, the
    host should perform host-driven signature capture at this time. The device
    waits for the time period specified by **1.2.1.1.2.3 Signature Timing Window
    (Touch Only)**, providing a time window for the host to end the transaction
    by sending **Command 0x1801 - Request Cardholder Signature**. At the end of
    that time window, if the host has not called that command, the device
    returns to the idle state.
16. **(EMV Contactless Only)** For NFC Tag, the flow is as follows:
17. Use Start Transaction command with the NFC enabled in Contactless Reader
    Mode
18. If an NFC Tag is Detected
    1.  the terminal will send a notification that identifies the NFC card type,
        see **Notification 0x0101 - Transaction Information Update**
    2.  the terminal will send another notification with the UID as a payload,
        see **Table 309 - Notification Payload for Data Update, ARQC Update
        (Quick Chip), Data Attached**. If a card is configured with a random ID,
        its value will be changed every time the card gets detected. The host is
        responsible to retrieve the real UID.
19. No ARQC or BATCH data will be sent
20. The host application can continue interfacing with the NFC tag by sending
    pass-through commands
21. When an NFC Tag gets out of the field, the terminal sends **Notification
    0x0105 – 20 05 00 00 (PICC, NFC Tag, Tag Removed, Reserved)** indicating
    that the Tag has been removed.
22. **(MCE Only)** For manual card entry, the sequence of events is as follows:
23. The host composes a command request in the format below with **Manual Entry
    Mode** parameters defined and other reader modes empty and sends it to the
    device. The host may cancel the transaction in process by calling **Command
    0x1008 - Cancel Transaction**. The device presents a sequence of pages based
    on the setting of **Property 1.2.1.1.4.5 MIFARE Plus AES_Key1.**
24. The device creates Track 1 and 2 data based on the entered values.
25. The device sends instances of **Notification 0x0101 - Transaction
    Information Update** to report each of the following:
    1.  Manual Card Entry, Card Event, Data Entered, Reserved
        1.  Manual Card Entry, Data Update, ARQC Update, Data Attached
            1.  Manual Card Entry, Data Update, Batch Update, Data Attached
26. The device sends **Notification 0x0105 - Transaction Operation Complete** to
    report **Manual Card Entry, Transaction Completed, Reserved, Reserved**.
18. Tip Feature **(Touch Only)**

Tip Operation Use Case Mode 1A

1.  Use Tag A4 for Tip and Tax Options
2.  Use Byte 1 of Tag 81 under A4 to specify Tip mode
    1.  0x01 = Use % mode
    2.  0x02 = Use Amount mode
3.  Bytes 2 through 31 of Tag 81 specifies the % or \$ value to show for Buttons
    1 thru 6. There is a button mode to control whether the button is going to
    show \$/%, CUSTOM, NO TIP, or is disabled.
4.  Tag 82 is the Tax Amount to Display
5.  DF5D = Tip Amount, DF5E = Tax Amount are used for reporting back to the host
    application.
6.  If available, tags DF5D and DF5E will be sent in the ARQC Data, see **Table
    19 - EMV ARQC (DynaPro Format) Type** .
7.  The value of Tag 9F02 provided in command 0x1001 will be updated by the
    Device by adding TIP and TAX before passing that value to the kernels.
8.  See **Tip & Tax Display Limits (Touch Only)** for display limitations.

Tip Operation Use Case Mode 1B

1.  If **Property 1.1.1.1.1.1B Interac Contact Card Terminal Capability ONLINE
    PIN Support Disable** is Enabled, and there is a socket connection with the
    host, the device will show the **START SALE** button.
2.  When the cardholder touches the **START SALE** button, the device will
    automatically start a transaction by asking cardholder to enter the
    transaction amount. The device will show the **CUSTOM AMOUN**T screen. Press
    **ENTER** to set transaction amount. The Start Transaction parameters are
    taken from the settings of these properties
    1.  **Property 1.1.1.1.2.2 Tip Mode(Touch Only)**
    2.  Property 1.1.1.1.2.6 Tip Mode Enable Submit on Amount Button Press
    3.  **Property 1.1.1.1.3.2 Reader Options (Touch Only)**
    4.  **Property 1.1.1.1.3.3 Transaction Options (Touch Only)**
3.  The Device automatically sends a Notification – Transaction Information
    Update that a transaction has started, **Table 308 - Notification Detail
    Codes**.
4.  If the **CANCEL** button is touched, the device automatically sends a
    Notification – Transaction Information Update that a transaction is
    canceled, **Table 308 - Notification Detail Codes**.
5.  After amount is entered, device checks **Property 1.1.1.1.2.2 Tip Mode(Touch
    Only)** to determine if TIP mode is enabled, as well as the TIP parameters.
    The Device will show the **TIP SCREEN** or **CUSTOM AMT** screen per
    cardholder selection. Press **SUBMIT** to set TIP amount.
6.  The device checks **Property 1.1.1.1.2.3 Tax Rate (Touch Only**) to
    determine if taxes need to be calculated. If enabled, device calculates the
    Taxes per the tax rate specified in the property.
7.  If tax function is enabled, the device checks **Property 1.1.1.1.2.4 Display
    Tax or Surcharge (Touch Only)** to determine how to show the label, tax or
    surcharge in the **SUMMARY SCREEN**
8.  Tax is only calculated on the amount entered, excluding TIP.
9.  Total Amount = Amount + Tip + Tax Total Amount is the value that will be
    used for Tag 9F02 of the transaction flow.
10. See **Tip & Tax Display Limits (Touch Only)** for display limitations.
11. Audio Transducer Beep Flow:
12. Upon NFC tag detection, notify HOST
13. Host sends 0x1001 to Start Transaction
14. After NFC is activated - No Beep
15. Host goes thru several Pass-Through commands to R/W NFC
16. A parameter will be added to the Pass-Through command API to indicate if
    this is the last command
17. If this is the last command, Device -\> Single Beep to indicate CARD CAN BE
    REMOVED. Turn-Off RF to shut down-card.
18. If an error condition is detected, the device will end session, double-beep,
    Turn-Off RF to shut down the card.
20. Command 0x1001 – Start a Payment Transaction with an option to show
    functional button Right **(Display Only)**

The host uses this command to start a payment transaction with an option to
display a **Present a Card** page and a green functional button Right (e.g.
Service Request button).

When the cardholder presses the **Service Request** button, the device will send
a notification, show **PLEASE WAIT** and await the next command from the host.

![](Images/c1e61c1b3177e454bb19be3f4f8d42d6.png)

The host uses **Command 0x1001** to start a payment transaction. If the battery
charge is five percent or less, a response is returned indicating that the
command has not been executed. See **Table 72 - Response Example for Command
0x1001 – Start Transaction Command not executed due to Battery Charge State**.

| 84  | 02  | Transaction Options This parameter is a bitmask (ORed bits) that sets various device behaviors that change the transaction flow or the way the device reports transaction results, as follows:  Byte 1 Apple VAS Mode (**Apple / Google VAS Only, set to 0 if not supported**)  Bits 0, 1 0x00 = **Apple/Google VAS Support Disabled** 0x01 = **VAS App OR Payment Mode (Single Mode)**. The device reads only Apple/Google VAS data from a tapped smartphone, or reads EMV payment data from a tapped card. When the device sends ARQC to conclude the transaction, it only includes either EMV payment data in container FC for cards, or includes VAS data in container FE for smartphones 0x02 = **VAS App and Payment Mode (Dual Mode)**. The device reads both Apple/Google VAS data and EMV payment data from a tapped smartphone, or reads EMV payment data from a tapped card. When device sends ARQC to the host to conclude the transaction, it includes EMV payment data in container FC and includes VAS data, if available, in container FE 0x03 = **VAS App Only Mode (VAS Mode)**. The device reads only Apple/Google VAS data from a tapped smartphone, and does not read data from a tapped card. If the tapped smartphone does not support VAS, the device does not detect or read from the smartphone. When the device send ARQC to conclude the transaction, it includes VAS data in container FE and does not include EMV payment data in container FC 0x04 = **Payment Only Mode (Payment Mode)**. The device operates the same as EMV mode (01). It reads only EMV payment data from a tapped smartphone or a tapped card. When the device sends ARQC to conclude the transaction, it includes EMV payment data in container FC and does not include VAS data in container FE.

For sending ARQC data and batch data, the device uses **EMV ARQC (DynaPro Format) Type** and **EMV Batch Data (DynaPro Format) Type**. Value 0 = Reserved. Bit 2 Signature Capture Control (MSR Only). Value 1 = Skip Signature Capture On Service Code. The device skips signature capture during an MSR-only transaction if the card’s service code indicates it is a chip card.  Value 0 = Do Not Skip Signature Capture. Bit 3 Display Amount for Quick Chip Transaction Flow Value 1 = Display Amount Value 0 = Do not Display Amount | B   | O   | 0x0003  |

### Command 0x1008 - Cancel Transaction

The host can use this command to cancel a transaction in progress that it
initiated using **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction**.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host has already called **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction** and the
    transaction is still in process.
2.  The host constructs the command request in the format below.
3.  The host sends the command request to the device.
4.  The device sends a response in the format below to the host.
    1.  If the transaction is in a state where it can not be canceled, the
        device’s response returns operation status detail **Failed, Device State
        Issue, Cannot Cancel**.
    2.  If there is no transaction in progress, the device’s response returns
        operation status detail codes **Failed, Device State Issue, No
        Transaction**.
5.  If the device successfully cancels the transaction, the device’s response
    returns operation status detail **All Good, Requested Operation Was
    Successful**, shows **CANCELED** on the display (if any), and returns to the
    idle state.

Byte 0 = 0xA0 Byte 1 = Address to Write Byte 2 to 17 = 16 Bytes of Data to Write (only least significant 4 bytes are written)  Note: This command is sent in 2 steps, which the Firmware will handle \<CMD\>\<Address to Write\>\<CRCH\>\<CRCL\> \<16 Bytes of Data to Write\>\<CRCH\>\<CRCL\>                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| READ_CNT            | 2      | The READ_CNT command is used to read out the current value of the NFC one-way counter of the NTAG213, NTAG215 and NTAG216. The command has a single argument specifying the counter number and returns the 24-bit counter value of the corresponding counter. If the NFC_CNT_PWD_PROT bit is set to 1b the counter is password protected and can only be read with the READ_CNT command after a previous valid password authentication  Byte 0 = 0x39 Byte 1 = 0x02 (NFC Counter Address)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| PWD_AUTH            | 5      | A protected memory area can be accessed only after a successful password verification using the PWD_AUTH command. The AUTH0 configuration byte defines the protected area. It specifies the first page that the password mechanism protects. The level of protection can be configured using the PROT bit either for write protection or read/write protection. The PWD_AUTH command takes the password as parameter and, if successful, returns the password authentication acknowledge, PACK. By setting the AUTHLIM configuration bits to a value larger than 000b, the number of unsuccessful password verifications can be limited. Each unsuccessful authentication is then counted in a counter featuring anti-tearing support. After reaching the limit of unsuccessful attempts, the memory access specified in PROT, is no longer possible.  Byte 0 = 0x1B Byte 1..4 = password (4 bytes) |
| READ_SIG            | 2      | The READ_SIG command returns an IC specific, 32-byte ECC signature, to verify NXP Semiconductors as the silicon vendor. The signature is programmed at chip production and cannot be changed afterwards.  Byte 0 = 0x3C Byte 1 = 0x00, RFU                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Read                | 2-3    | The READ command requires a start page address, and returns the 16 bytes of four MIFARE Ultralight pages. For example if address (Addr) is 03h then pages 03h, 04h, 05h, 06h are returned. A rollover mechanism is implemented if the READ command address is near the end of the accessible memory area. This rollover mechanism is also used when at least part of the addressed pages is within a password protected area.  The READ command with an option of end page address returns the all n\*4 bytes of the addressed pages. For example if the start address is 03h and the end address is 07h then pages 03h, 04h, 05h, 06h and 07h are returned.  Byte 0 = 0x30 Byte 1 = Start Page Address Byte 2 = (optional) End Page Address                                                                                                                                                         |
| Fast Read           | 3      | The FAST_READ command requires a start page address and an end page address and returns the all n\*4 bytes of the addressed pages.

| CHECK TEARING_EVENT | 2      | The CHECK_TEARING_EVENT command enables the application to identify if a tearing event happened on a specified counter element. It takes the counter number as single argument and returns a specified valid flag for this counter. If the returned valid flag is not equal to the predefined value, a tearing event happened. Note, although a tearing event might have happened on the counter, a valid value corresponding to the last valid counter status is still available using the READ_CNT command.  Byte 0 = 0x3E Byte 1 = 0x00..0x02 (counter number from 0x00 to 0x02)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| VCSL                | 21     | The VCSL command is used to enable a unique identification and selection process across different MIFARE product-based cards and card implementations on mobile devices. The command requires a 16-byte installation identifier IID and a 4-byte PCD capability value as parameters. The parameters are present to support compatibility to other MIFARE product-based devices but are not used or checked inside the MF0ULx1. Nevertheless, the number of bytes is checked for correctness. The answer to the VCSL command is the virtual card type identifier VCTID. This identifier indicates the type of card or ticket. Using this information, the reader can decide whether the ticket belongs to the installation or not.  Byte 0 = 0x4B Byte 1 to 16 = 16-byte IID (installation identifier, can be any number) Byte 17 to 20 = 4-byte PCDCAPS (PCD capabilities, can be any number)        |

| Read                | 2-3    | The READ command takes the page address as a parameter. Only addresses 00h to 2Bh are decoded. For higher addresses the MF0ICU2 returns a NAK. The MF0ICU2 responds to the READ command by sending 16 bytes starting from the page address defined in the command (e.g. if ADR is 03h, pages 03h, 04h, 05h, 06h are returned)  A roll-over mechanism is implemented to continue reading from page 00h once the end of the accessible memory is reached. For example, reading from address 29h on a MF0ICU2 results in pages 29h, 2Ah, 2Bh and 00h being returned.  The following conditions apply if part of the memory is protected by the 3DES authentication for read access: • if the MF0ICU2 is in the ACTIVE state – addressing a page which is equal or higher than AUTH0 results in a NAK response – addressing a page lower than AUTH0 results in data being returned with the roll-over mechanism occurring just before the AUTH0 defined page  • if the MF0ICU2 is in the AUTHENTICATED state – the READ command behaves like on a MF0ICU2 without access protection.  The READ command with an option of end page address returns the all n\*4 bytes of the addressed pages. For example if the start address is 03h and the end address is 07h then pages 03h, 04h, 05h, 06h and 07h are returned.  Byte 0 = 0x30 Byte 1 = Start Page Address Byte 2 = (optional) End Page Address |
| Write               | 6      | The WRITE command is used to program the lock bytes in page 02h, the OTP bytes in page 03h, data bytes in pages 04h to 27h, configuration data from page 28h to 2B and keys from page 2Ch to 2Fh. A WRITE command is performed page-wise, programming 4 bytes in a page.  Byte 0 = 0xA2 Byte 1 = Address to Write Byte 2 to 5 = 4 Bytes of Data to Write                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Compatibility Write | 18     | The COMPATIBILITY WRITE command was implemented to accommodate the established MIFARE PCD infrastructure. Even though 16 bytes are transferred to the MF0ICU2, only the least significant 4 bytes (bytes 0 to 3) will be written to the specified address. It is recommended to set the remaining bytes 4 to 15 to all 0.  Byte 0 = 0xA0 Byte 1 = Address to Write Byte 2 to 17 = 16 Bytes of Data to Write (only least significant 4 bytes are written)  Note: This command is sent in 2 steps, which the Firmware will handle \<CMD\>\<Address to Write\>\<CRCH\>\<CRCL\> \<16 Bytes of Data to Write\>\<CRCH\>\<CRCL\>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| AUTHENTICATE        | 2      | The AUTHENTICATE command is used to authenticate the MF0ICU2 using 2 keys 3DES encryption in Cipher-Block Chaining (CBC) mode as described in ISO/IEC 10116. The 16-byte of the 2keys 3DES are programmed to card memory pages from 2Ch to 2Fh. The key itself can be written during personalization or at any later stage using the WRITE or COMPATIBILITY WRITE with Byte 0 is always sent first.

| Read         | 2-3    | The READ command requires a start page address, and returns the 16 bytes of four pages. For example, if address (Addr) is 03h then pages 03h, 04h, 05h, 06h are returned. So called roll-over mechanism (described later) applies if the READ command address is near the end of the accessible memory area. Same mechanism applies if at least part of the addressed pages is within an authentication protected area  In the default state of MIFARE Ultralight AES, all memory pages in the range from 00h to 3Bh are allowed as Addr parameter to the READ command. Addressing a memory page above the limit results in a NAK response. A roll-over mechanism is implemented to continue reading from page 00h once the end of the accessible memory is reached if at least first addressed page is within allowed limit.   **Remark**: AES key values can never be directly read out of the memory. When reading from the pages holding key values, all 00h bytes are returned.  The READ command with an option of end page address returns the all n\*4 bytes of the addressed pages. For example if the start address is 03h and the end address is 07h then pages 03h, 04h, 05h, 06h and 07h are returned.

| WRITE_SIG    | 6      | The WRITE_SIG command allows the writing of a customized originality signature into the dedicated originality signature memory. The WRITE_SIG command requires an originality signature block address, and writes 4 bytes of data into the addressed originality signature block.  In the initial state of MIFARE Ultralight AES, the following originality signature blocks 00h to 0Bh are valid Addr parameters to the WRITE_SIG command. Addressing a memory block beyond the limits above results in a NAK response from MIFARE Ultralight AES.  If the originality signature is locked or permanently locked, a WRITE_SIG command results in a NAK response from the MIFARE Ultralight AES.

| VCSL         | 21     | The VCSL command is used to enable a unique identification and selection process across different physical MIFARE product-based cards and virtual MIFARE implementations. The command requires a 16-byte installation identifier IID and a 4-byte PCD capability value as parameters. The parameters are present to support compatibility to other MIFARE product-based devices, but are not used or checked inside the MIFARE Ultralight AES.

| AUTHENTICATE | 2      | The AUTHENTICATE command is used to authenticate with a 3-pass mutual authentication the MIFARE Ultralight AES and PCD. The cryptographic method is based on AES in Cipher-Block chaining (CBC) mode according to NIST Special Publication 800-38A. The used key is a 128-bit AES Key. Remark: To reduce the risk on card-only side channel attack to the AES keys, a failed authentication limit (AUTH_LIM) can be set. The 16 bytes of the AES [DataProtKey] are programmed to memory pages from 30h to 33h. Keys themselves can be written during personalization or at any later stage in a secure environment, as long as the key is not locked for update in the user configuration segment. AES [UIDRetrKey] is stored in memory addresses from 34h until 37h. In case keys are not locked, MIFARE Ultralight AES allows to change AES-keys without authentication as long as AUTH0 is not set to a page address before or at page address where keys bytes are stored. Otherwise MIFARE Ultralight AES requires to be in the AUTHENTICATED state to allow to write AES keys. The key itself can be written using the WRITE with Byte 0 is always sent first. On example of AES [DataProtKey] = 000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0Fh, the command sequence needed for key programming with WRITE command is: • A2 30 0F 0E 0D 0C • A2 31 0B 0A 09 08 • A2 32 07 06 05 04 • A2 33 03 02 01 00 On example of AES [UIDRetrKey] = 000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0Fh, the command sequence needed for key programming with WRITE command is: • A2 34 0F 0E 0D 0C • A2 35 0B 0A 09 08 • A2 36 07 06 05 04 • A2 37 03 02 01 00 The 16-byte of the same AES [DataProtKey] are programed to the Device using **Property 1.2.1.1.4.2 MIFARE Ultralight AES DataProtKey**. The 16-byte of the same AES [UIDRetrKey] are programed to the Device using **Property 1.2.1.1.4.3 MIFARE Ultralight AES UIDRetrKey**. The 16-byte of the AES [OriginalityKey] are programed to the Device using **Property 1.2.1.1.4.4 MIFARE Ultralight AES OriginalityKey.** This key value is only known by NXP.  Byte 0 = 0x1A Byte 1 = Key option  0x00 = DataProtKey   0x01 = UIDRetrKey  0x02 = OriginalityKey |

### Command 0x1101 – Pass Through Command for MIFARE Classic/MINI®/Plus SL1 (Security Level 1), Type 2

After a MIFARE Tag is activated, the host uses this command to send commands and
receive responses to and from a MIFARE tag.

For MIFARE Plus EV1/EV2/SE/X at SL1 (Security Level 1), the tag is discovered as
MIFARE Classic, and can use the same functionality as MIFARE Classic 1K/4K
commands in **Table 95 – MIFARE Classic/MINI**® Commands**.** Furthermore, an
additional optional AES authentication is available in this level without
affecting the MIFARE Classic 1K/4K functionality. The authenticity of the card
can be proven using strong cryptographic means with this additional
functionality. In addition to the backwards compatibility mode, MIFARE Plus card
can be switched to higher security levels. After MIFARE Plus is authenticated
with AES Security Level 1 Key, the Device doesn’t auto detect an error from the
MIFARE Tag has been removed to end the pass-through session. To end the
pass-through session, the Host application can send the last command, CANCEL
command (0xFF), or receive error response from the MIFARE Tag.

### Command 0x1103 – Pass Through Command for MIFARE Plus, Type 2

After a MIFARE Plus EV1/EV2/SE/X Tag is activated, the Host uses this command to
send commands and receive responses to and from a MIFARE Plus tag.

For MIFARE Plus SE/X, the Device will not auto detect an error from the MIFARE
Tag that has been removed to end the pass-through session. To end the
pass-through session, the Host application can send the last command, CANCEL
command (0xFF), or receive error response from the MIFARE Tag.

For MIFARE Plus EV1/EV2 at Security Level 3, after the first Read/Write/Value
operation, the Device will not auto detect an error from the MIFARE Tag that has
been removed to end the pass-through session. To end the pass-through session,
the Host application can send the last command, CANCEL command (0xFF), or
receive error response from the MIFARE Tag.

After the card is configured to successfully switch to Security Level 1, the
card will be discovered as MIFARE Classic 1K/4K and can use the same
functionality as MIFARE Classic 1K/4K commands.

## Command Group 0x18nn - User Interface

### Command 0x1801 - Request Cardholder Signature (Touch Only)

The host uses this command to prompt a cardholder for a signature.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The device completes a transaction after the host invokes **Command 0x1001 -
    Start Transaction**. At the end of the transaction, the device has provided
    data to the host in **Notification 0x0105 - Transaction Operation
    Complete**. The host may send Command 0x1801 to the device to get a
    signature file without doing a transaction. The signature file can be
    encrypted if enabled.
2.  The host decides whether to request a signature from the cardholder. For
    example:
    1.  If the Notification Detail in **Notification 0x0105 - Transaction
        Operation Complete** indicates Signature Capture Requested.
    2.  If an application-specific rule requires requesting a signature.
3.  If the host determines it should request a signature, it composes a command
    request in the format below.
4.  The device presents a signature capture interface to the cardholder on the
    display.
5.  The device sends **Notification 0x1805 - User Interface Operation Complete**
    to the host to report data available, timeout, or hardware failure.
6.  If the device reported data available, the host uses **Command 0xD821 -
    Start Get File from Device** to request file type **Signature Capture File**
    to retrieve the data as a **Signature Capture File Type**.

### Command 0x1802 - Report Cardholder Selection

The host uses this command to provide a cardholder selection to the device when
the device itself does not have a display or inputs to prompt the cardholder for
a selection.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host has already invoked **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction** and the
    transaction is still in process.
2.  During the transaction, if the device does not have a display or touchscreen
    but needs to show information to the cardholder or needs the cardholder to
    make a selection, it sends the host **Notification 0x1803 - User Interface
    Host Action Request** to report Display / Cardholder Selection and
    supporting information.
3.  The host uses its user interface to request a selection from the cardholder
    based on the information and selectable items provided by the notification
    message.
4.  The host sends the user selection to the device by sending the command in
    the format below.

### Command 0x1803 - Display Message (Display Only)

The host uses this command to request that the device display a message for the
cardholder.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host ensures the device is not currently running another command, for
    example, that it is not running a transaction using **Command 0x1001 - Start
    Transaction**.
2.  The host selects the message it wants to display from the list of available
    pre-determined strings.
3.  The host composes a command request in the format below, and sends it to the
    device.
4.  The device displays the requested message.
    1.  If the Timeout parameter is set to Infinite, the device returns a
        command response message with Response Status, Operation Status Summary
        byte set to 0x00 (OK, Done) after which the host is free to send further
        commands.
    2.  If the timeout parameter is not set to Infinite:
        1.  The device returns a command response message with its Response
            Status, Operation Status Summary byte set to 0x01 (OK, Started /
            Running).
        2.  While the host is waiting for the timeout to expire, it should not
            send any commands to the device, because the device is busy
            processing the current command.
        3.  After the timeout period expires, the device blanks the display and
            sends **Notification 0x1805 - User Interface Operation Complete** to
            inform the host.

### Command 0x1804 - Read Barcode (BCR Only)

The host uses this command to direct the device to arm or disarm the barcode
reader for reading a barcode outside the scope of a transaction. This is an
immediate directive. To read barcodes within the scope of a transaction, use
**Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction** and its barcode reader parameters
instead.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host ensures the device is not currently running another command, for
    example, that it is not running a transaction using **Command 0x1001 - Start
    Transaction**.
2.  The host composes a command request in the format below and sends it to the
    device.
3.  If the device has a display, it shows a prompt **SCAN BARCODE**.
4.  The device enables the barcode reader.
    1.  If the **Timeout** parameter is set to **Infinite**:
        1.  The device returns a command response message with Response Status,
            Operation Status Summary byte set to 0x00 (OK, Done) after which the
            host is free to send further commands.
        2.  The host may end the barcode reading session by calling this command
            again with the **Enable** parameter set to **Disable**.
    2.  If the **Timeout** parameter is set to a value other than **Infinite**:
        1.  The device returns a command response message with its Response
            Status, Operation Status Summary byte set to 0x01 (OK, Started /
            Running).
        2.  While the host is waiting for the timeout to expire, it should not
            send any commands to the device, because the device is busy
            processing the current command.
        3.  After the device reads a barcode or the timeout period expires, the
            device sends **Notification 0x1805 - User Interface Operation
            Complete** to report Barcode Reader / Read Barcode Result and
            additional supporting information.

### Command 0x1805 - Buzzer

The host uses this command to start a buzzer for playing a sequence of tones.
Each sequence can have a minimum of 1 to maximum of 10 tones.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host ensures the device is not currently running another command, for
    example, that it is not running a transaction using **Command 0x1001 - Start
    Transaction**.
2.  The host composes a command request in the format below and sends it to the
    device.
3.  The device plays a specific tone sequence as the command specified. After
    finish, the device sends **Notification 0x1805 - User Interface Operation
    Complete** to report Buzzer/Buzzer Result.

    The host should wait for **Notification 0x1805 - User Interface Operation
    Complete** before sending another command.

    If the buzzer is current playing a sequence of tones and any transaction
    that uses the buzzer to make a sound is started, the device will stop the
    buzzer for that transaction to take over.

### Command 0x1821 - Show Image (Display Only)

The host uses this command to trigger the device to immediately show a
pre-loaded image on the display, provided the device is not in a mode that has
exclusive use of the display (such as during a transaction). This is an
immediate and temporary directive. For a solution that affects the device’s idle
page behavior on a more permanent basis, see **Property 1.2.3.1.1.1 Custom Idle
Page Image**. This command is different from **Command 0x1823 - Show Bitmap
Image** in that the bitmaps are pre-loaded and persistently stored in the device
and can not be composited with each other.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host makes sure it has loaded the image into at least one of the
    device’s Custom Idle Page Image slots using **Command 0xD812 - Start Send
    File to Device (Unsecured)**.
2.  The host makes sure the device is in Active/Idle state (meaning the display
    is fully powered on and is not in a mode that has exclusive use of the
    display, such as processing a transaction).
3.  The host calls this command to show the image loaded into the desired slot
    number.
4.  The device shows the specified image on the display until the device is no
    longer in Active/Idle.

### Command 0x1822 - Show QR Code (Display Only)

The host uses this command to direct the device to immediately show a QR code on
the display, provided the device is not in a mode that has exclusive use of the
display (such as during a transaction).

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host ensures the device is not currently running another command, for
    example, that it is not running a transaction using **Command 0x1001 - Start
    Transaction**.
2.  The host selects the data for the QR code it wants to display.
3.  The host composes a command request in the format below and sends it to the
    device.
4.  The device generates and displays the QR code.
    1.  If the **Display Time** parameter is set to **Indefinite**, the device
        returns a command response message with Response Status, Operation
        Status Summary byte set to 0x00 (OK, Done) after which the host is free
        to send further commands.
    2.  If the **Display Time** parameter is set to a number of seconds:
        1.  The device returns a command response message with its Response
            Status, Operation Status Summary byte set to 0x01 (OK, Started /
            Running).
        2.  While the host is waiting for the timeout to expire, it should not
            send any commands to the device, because the device is busy
            processing the current command.
        3.  After the timeout period expires, the device unlocks to allow other
            commands and sends **Notification 0x1805 - User Interface Operation
            Complete** to report **Display** / **Display Message** / **Timed
            Out** / **Reserved**.

### Command 0x1823 - Show Bitmap Image (Display Only)

The host uses this command to trigger the device to immediately show a bitmap
file the host includes as a parameter, provided the device is not in a mode that
has exclusive use of the display (such as during a transaction).

This is an immediate and temporary directive. For a solution that affects the
device’s idle page behavior on a more permanent basis, see **Property
1.2.3.1.1.1 Custom Idle Page Image**. This command is different from **Command
0x1821 - Show Image (Display Only)** in that the host sends bitmaps as
parameters instead of pre-loading them, and the host can call this command
multiple times without clearing the display to show multiple bitmaps on the
display at the same time.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host ensures the device is not currently running another command, for
    example, that it is not running a transaction using **Command 0x1001 - Start
    Transaction**.
2.  The host selects a bitmap file it wants to display.
3.  The host composes a command request in the format below and sends it to the
    device.
4.  If the host includes the **Background Color** parameter, the device clears
    the display using the specified color. If the host does not include that
    parameter, the device does not clear the display.
5.  The device shows the bitmap with the upper left corner at the specified **X
    Position** and **Y Position**. If the host omits either parameter, the
    device centers the bitmap along the unspecified axis.
    1.  If the **Display Time** parameter is **Indefinite** or is not included,
        the device returns a command response message with Response Status,
        Operation Status Summary byte set to 0x00 (OK, Done) after which the
        host is free to send further commands.
    2.  If the timeout parameter is set to a specific number of seconds:
        1.  The device returns a command response message with its Response
            Status, Operation Status Summary byte set to 0x01 (OK, Started /
            Running).
        2.  While the host is waiting for the timeout to expire, it should not
            send any commands to the device, because the device is busy
            processing the current command.
        3.  After the timeout period expires, the device unlocks to allow other
            commands and sends **Notification 0x1805 - User Interface Operation
            Complete** to inform the host.

### Command 0x1840 – Card Emulation

Card emulation is initiated by receiving a 0x1840 command from the host. The
device will prepare card emulation with the parameters provided in the command
and start card emulation.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host ensures the device is not currently running another command, for
    example, that it is not running a transaction or PIN entry.
2.  The host composes a command request in the format below and sends it to the
    device.
3.  The device receives the command and verifies that the parameters are valid
    and the device is in a state that allows the execution of card emulation.
4.  If the device has a display, a prompt will be displayed asking the customer
    to tap their phone to the device.
5.  If the timeout parameter is not included or set to 0x00, then there is no
    timeout. Or, if the timeout parameter is set to a specific number of
    seconds, the device returns a command response message with its Operation
    Status Summary byte set to 0x01 (OK, Started / Running).
6.  The host may issue a 0x1840 command with Tag 0x81 set to 0x00 to cancel the
    execution of card emulation.
7.  After the timeout expires, host cancel or the card is read, the device sends
    a 0x1805 notification to inform the host.

### Command 0x1F03 - Extend Session (Session Management Only)

The host can use this command to extend a session for open protocol interfaces,
such as the WLAN interface, which require session management to meet PCI
requirements.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host establishes a session with the device on a given interface. For the
    WLAN interface, a session starts when the host establishes a TLS websocket
    connection with the device.
2.  The device starts a countdown timer for a 30 minute session timeout period.
3.  Five minutes before the session timeout period expires, the device starts
    repeatedly (every minute) sending **Notification 0x1001 - Device Information
    Update** to report **Session Management / Session Expiring Soon**.
4.  The host may extend the session multiple times, until the device
    automatically resets to meet PCI’s 24 hour self-test requirement, by sending
    any command request using the same interface before the timeout occurs. Upon
    receiving the command, the device resets the session countdown timer to 30
    minutes. This helps prevent the session from expiring while the host is
    actively using the device, including when the device is performing a
    transaction. If the host wants to extend the session but does not need to
    send another command, it may follow these steps at any time during the
    session:
    1.  The host constructs the command request in the format below.
    2.  The host sends the command request to the device.
    3.  The device sends a response in the format below to the host.
    4.  The device resets the session countdown timer to 30 minutes.
5.  When the session expires, the device closes the websocket connection.

For the WLAN interface, if the device is configured to allow connections to more
than one client at the same time with **Property 1.2.2.1.1.A Maximum Client
Connections** and more than one client is connected, then the following applies.
There is always only a single session and it applies to all clients. There is
not a separate session for each client. The session starts when the first client
connects. Only one client needs to send a command on its connection to extend
the session. The other clients do not need to send any commands. When the
session expires, all clients will be disconnected.

### Command 0x1F04 – Terminate Bluetooth® LE Connection (Bluetooth® LE Only)

The host can use this command to terminate a Bluetooth® LE connection. The host
may also be able to terminate a Bluetooth® LE connection directly without using
this command.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host constructs the command request for **Device in** the format below.
2.  The host sends the command request to the device.
3.  The device sends a response in the format below to the host.
4.  The device terminates the Bluetooth® LE connection within around 500ms.

then forget the device and re-pair the device on any host that it was previously
paired with if that host needs to communicate with the device again.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host constructs the command request for **Command 0x1F01 - Reset
    Device** in the format below.
2.  The host sends the command request to the device.
3.  The device sends a response in the format below to the host.

## Command Group 0x20nn - Banking Functions (Touch/Display Only)

### Command 0x2001 - Request PIN with Host Supplied Account Data (Banking Functions Only)

This command directs the device to prompt the cardholder to enter a PIN when a
card is not present or is not presented. The host is aware of the account
information and the device is not. To prompt the cardholder to present a card
before prompting for a PIN, use **Command 0x2002 - Request PIN with Card
Supplied Account Data (Banking Functions Only)** instead.

When the host calls this command, the device enters **PIN Entry Mode**, meaning
it starts a “PIN Entry session.” While in PIN Entry Mode:

-   The device ignores most other commands from the host, similar to the way it
    behaves while **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction** is running: Only
    essential commands and those that are relevant to the current PIN entry
    session are allowed.
-   When the device is waiting for the host to take action, it resets the
    timeout clock and shows an interstitial **PLEASE WAIT** page until one of
    the following occurs:
    -   The host calls the same PIN entry command again to show another UI
        sequence or to end the PIN entry session, or
    -   The host calls another allowed command (ending the PIN entry session),
        or
    -   The device has shown **PLEASE WAIT** until the **Timeout** the host
        specified in the command has expired (ending the PIN entry session).
-   The host can call this command again and again as needed, to invoke any
    number and any combination of available PIN Entry User Interface Sequences.
    This allows the host to determine the number of retries, and to exercise
    flexible fine-grained control over the end to end “sequence of sequences.”
-   The host may cancel the PIN entry session by calling this command again with
    **User Interface Sequence = Cancel PIN Session**. In response, the device
    shows an interstitial page **PIN Entry Canceled** for 2 seconds, then
    returns to idle.

The usual sequence is as follows:

1.  The host invokes this command using the format in **Table 177**.
2.  If an error occurs, the device returns a command response message as shown
    in **Table 178** with Response Status, Operation Status Summary byte set to
    0x80 (Failed to start operation), and terminates the command.
3.  If no error occurs, the device returns a command response message as shown
    in **Table 178** with Response Status, Operation Status Summary byte set to
    0x01 (OK, Started / Running), and enters PIN Entry Mode.
4.  The device shows one of the predefined messages specified by the **User
    Interface Sequence** parameter and waits up to the specified **Timeout** for
    the cardholder to enter a PIN.
5.  If the host has specified **User Interface Sequence** = **Enter PIN / Enter
    PIN Again**, the device automatically prompts the cardholder to enter the
    PIN a second time.
6.  When the command completes (PIN entry done, cardholder or operator canceled,
    or **Wait Time** timeout), the device sends **Notification 0x0205 - Banking
    Functions Operation Complete** to report **Touchscreen** / **PIN Entry**. If
    PIN entry is successful, the report also contains a payload as shown in
    **Table 326**. The EPB format the device uses depends on the parameters the
    host specified in the command:
    1.  If the host provided the **Account Number** data in the command, the
        device creates the EPB using the **PIN Block Format** the host specified
        in the command.
    2.  If the host did not provide the **Account Number** data in the command,
        the device creates the EPB using ISO format 1.
7.  If the host is performing a PIN Verification function (such as **User
    Interface Sequence** = **Enter PIN**), the host software uses the financial
    institution’s backend systems to compare the EPB to the account information
    on file, receives a result as to whether the entered PIN was correct, and
    reports the results to the teller and to the device.
    1.  If the PIN is correct, the host calls the same command again with
        parameter **User Interface Sequence = PIN Entry Successful** to indicate
        success and exit PIN Entry Mode. The device responds by showing an
        interstitial page **PIN Entry Successful** for 2 seconds, then returns
        to idle mode. The device sounds the EMV success tone to audibly report
        the result and call the cardholder’s attention to the display.
    2.  If the PIN is incorrect, depending on host-driven retry rules and the
        history of the session:
        1.  The host may call the same command again with parameter **User
            Interface Sequence = PIN Incorrect, Try Again** to show the **PIN
            Incorrect, Try Again** prompt. The device sounds the EMV failure
            tone to audibly report the result and call the cardholder’s
            attention to the display.
        2.  The host may call the same command again with other **User Interface
            Sequences** as desired.
        3.  The host must eventually finalize by calling the same command again
            with parameters to end the PIN entry session. If the host calls the
            command with **User Interface Sequence = PIN Entry Failed** to
            trigger final failure (as opposed to final success described above),
            the device shows an interstitial page **PIN Entry Failed** for 2
            seconds, then returns to idle. The device also sounds the EMV
            failure tone to audibly report the result and call the cardholder’s
            attention to the display.
8.  If the host is performing a PIN Entry / Re-PIN function (such as **User
    Interface Sequence** = **Enter PIN / Enter PIN Again**), after the
    cardholder enters the PIN a second time:
    1.  If the PINs match:
        1.  The device sends the Encrypted PIN block to the host by sending
            **Notification 0x0205 - Banking Functions Operation Complete** to
            report **Touchscreen / PIN Entry / Success / Data Attached**. The
            host may pass this PIN block to backend systems for processing and
            storage.
        2.  The host calls the same command again with parameter **User
            Interface Sequence = PIN Entry Successful** to indicate success and
            exit PIN Entry Mode. The device responds by showing an interstitial
            page **PIN Entry Successful** for 2 seconds, then returns to idle
            mode. The device also sounds the EMV success tone to audibly report
            the result and call the cardholder’s attention to the display.
    2.  If the PINs do not match, the device sends **Notification 0x0205 -
        Banking Functions Operation Complete** to report **Touchscreen** / **PIN
        Entry / Operation Failed / PIN Verify Failed**. Depending on host-driven
        retry rules and the history of the session:
        1.  The host may call the same command again with parameter **User
            Interface Sequence = Enter PIN /Enter PIN Again** to prompt the
            cardholder to enter a PIN twice again.
        2.  The host must eventually finalize by calling the same command again
            with parameters to end the PIN entry session. If the host calls the
            command with **User Interface Sequence = PIN Entry Failed** to
            trigger final failure (as opposed to final success described above),
            the device shows an interstitial page **PIN Entry Failed** for 2
            seconds, then returns to idle. The device also sounds the EMV
            failure tone to audibly report the result and call the cardholder’s
            attention to the display.

### Command 0x2002 - Request PIN with Card Supplied Account Data (Banking Functions Only)

This command directs the device to prompt the cardholder to present their card
by swiping, dipping or tapping, and to enter a PIN. To prompt the cardholder for
a PIN without presenting a card when the host knows the account number already,
use **Command 0x2001 - Request PIN with Host Supplied Account Data (Banking
Functions Only)** instead.

When the host calls this command, the device enters **PIN Entry Mode**, meaning
it starts a “PIN Entry session.” While in PIN Entry Mode:

-   The device ignores most other commands from the host, similar to the way it
    behaves while **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction** is running: Only
    essential commands and those that are relevant to the current PIN Entry
    session are allowed.
-   When the device is waiting for the host to take action, it resets the
    timeout clock and shows an interstitial **PLEASE WAIT** page until one of
    the following occurs:
    -   The host calls the same PIN entry command again to show another UI
        sequence or to end the PIN entry session, or
    -   The host calls another allowed command (ending the PIN entry session),
        or
    -   The device has shown **PLEASE WAIT** until the **Timeout** the host
        specified in the command has expired (ending the PIN entry session).
-   The host can call this command again and again as needed, to invoke any
    number and any combination of available PIN Entry User Interface Sequences.
    This allows the host to determine number of retries, and to exercise
    flexible fine-grained control over the end to end “sequence of sequences.”
-   The host may cancel the PIN entry session by calling this command again with
    **User Interface Sequence = Cancel PIN Session**. In response, the device
    shows an interstitial page **PIN Entry Canceled** for 2 seconds, then
    returns to idle.

The usual sequence is as follows:

1.  The host invokes this command using the format in **Table 181**.
2.  If an error occurs, the device returns a command response message as shown
    in **Table 182** with Response Status, Operation Status Summary byte set to
    0x80 (Failed to start operation), and terminates the command.
3.  If no error occurs, the device returns a command response message as shown
    in **Table 182** with Response Status, Operation Status Summary byte set to
    0x01 (OK, Started / Running), and enters PIN Entry Mode.
4.  The device shows a prompt requesting the cardholder present one of the
    payment technologies specified in the **Reader Options** parameter, and
    waits up to the specified **Timeout** for the cardholder to respond.
5.  After the cardholder presents a card, the device sends **Notification 0x0201
    \- Banking Functions Information Update** to report the payment technology
    being used / Card Event / Detected.
6.  If the cardholder swiped a magnetic stripe card, the device reads Track 2
    data.
7.  If cardholder inserts an ICC or taps a PICC, the device reads records from
    the card and attempts to retrieve tags 57 (Track 2 Equivalent Data) and 5A
    (Primary Account number). It then powers off the card without performing the
    first Generate Application Cryptogram, so the card does not increment its
    transaction counters.
8.  If an error occurs, the device terminates the command and PIN entry session
    and sends **Notification 0x0205 - Banking Functions Operation Complete** to
    report Touchscreen / PIN Entry / Operation Failed / Account Data Capture
    Failed.
9.  The device shows one of the predefined messages specified by the **User
    Interface Sequence** parameter, and waits up to the specified **Timeout**
    for the cardholder to enter a PIN.
10. If the host has specified **User Interface Sequence** = **Enter PIN / Enter
    PIN Again**, the device automatically prompts the cardholder to enter the
    PIN a second time.
11. When the command completes (PIN entry done, cardholder or operator canceled,
    or **Wait Time** timeout), the device sends a **Notification 0x0205 -
    Banking Functions Operation Complete** to report **Touchscreen** **PIN
    Entry**. If PIN entry is successful, the report also contains a payload as
    shown in **Table 327**. The device creates the EPB using the **PIN Block
    Format** the host specified in the command.
12. If the host is performing a PIN Verification function (such as **User
    Interface Sequence** = **Enter PIN**), the host software uses the financial
    institution’s backend systems to compare the EPB to the account information
    on file, receives a result as to whether the entered PIN was correct, and
    reports the results to the teller and to the device.
    1.  If the PIN is correct, the host calls the same command again with
        parameter **User Interface Sequence = PIN Entry Successful** to indicate
        success and exit PIN Entry Mode. The device responds by showing an
        interstitial page **PIN Entry Successful** for 2 seconds, then returns
        to idle mode. The device sounds the EMV success tone to audibly report
        the result and call the cardholder’s attention to the display.
    2.  If the PIN is incorrect, depending on host-driven retry rules and the
        history of the session:
        1.  The host may call the same command again with parameter **User
            Interface Sequence = PIN Incorrect, Try Again** to show the **PIN
            Incorrect, Try Again** prompt. The device sounds the EMV failure
            tone to audibly report the result and call the cardholder’s
            attention to the display.
        2.  The host may call the same command again with other **User Interface
            Sequences** as desired.
        3.  The host must eventually finalize by calling the same command again
            with parameters to end the PIN entry session. If the host calls the
            command with **User Interface Sequence = PIN Entry Failed** to
            trigger final failure (as opposed to final success described above),
            the device shows an interstitial page **PIN Entry Failed** for 2
            seconds, then returns to idle. The device also sounds the EMV
            failure tone to audibly report the result and call the cardholder’s
            attention to the display.
13. If the host is performing a PIN Entry / Re-PIN function (such as **User
    Interface Sequence** = **Enter PIN / Enter PIN Again**), after the
    cardholder enters the PIN a second time:
    1.  If the PINs match:
        1.  The device sends the Encrypted PIN block to the host by sending
            **Notification 0x0205 - Banking Functions Operation Complete** to
            report **Touchscreen / PIN Entry / Success / Data Attached**. The
            host may pass this PIN block to backend systems for processing and
            storage.
        2.  The host calls the same command again with parameter **User
            Interface Sequence = PIN Entry Successful** to indicate success and
            exit PIN Entry Mode. The device responds by showing an interstitial
            page **PIN Entry Successful** for 2 seconds, then returns to idle
            mode. The device also sounds the EMV success tone to audibly report
            the result and call the cardholder’s attention to the display.
    2.  If the PINs do not match, the device sends **Notification 0x0205 -
        Banking Functions Operation Complete** to report **Touchscreen** / **PIN
        Entry / Operation Failed / PIN Verify Failed**. Depending on host-driven
        retry rules and the history of the session:
        1.  The host may call the same command again with parameter **User
            Interface Sequence = Enter PIN /Enter PIN Again** to prompt the
            cardholder to enter a PIN twice again.
        2.  The host must eventually finalize by calling the same command again
            with parameters to end the PIN entry session. If the host calls the
            command with **User Interface Sequence = PIN Entry Failed** to
            trigger final failure (as opposed to final success described above),
            the device shows an interstitial page **PIN Entry Failed** for 2
            seconds, then returns to idle. The device also sounds the EMV
            failure tone to audibly report the result and call the cardholder’s
            attention to the display.

## Command Group 0xD1nn - Settings and Information

### Command 0xD101 - Get Property

The host uses this command to get information about the device or its
configuration / settings.

Each data element representing device information or device configuration is
part of a tree of values and is uniquely identified by an Object Identifier
(also known as an Object ID or OID) as defined in **ITU-T X.660 \| ISO/IEC
9834-1**, which can be found by searching for **X.660** in the publications on
[www.itu.int](http://www.itu.int). This document refers to these data elements
collectively as **Properties**. The list of all properties and their
corresponding OIDs and other characteristics is provided in section **8
Configuration**.

This command can be used in multiple ways. For simplicity, this document
describes one possible way that does not require detailed knowledge of the
**X.660** specification.

To get a property, the sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host determines which property or tree branch of properties it wants to
    get from the device (see section **8 Configuration**).
2.  The host composes the command request in the format below, and sends it to
    the device.
3.  The device sends a response. If the request succeeded, the response includes
    the value(s) of the requested property or properties. If it did not succeed,
    the device returns a failure response with no command-specific parameters.

This can also be populated with fewer numbers from the OID, in which case the remaining numbers of the OID of the Property or set of Properties you wish to retrieve must be included in the **Property OID Remainder**.  For simplicity, populate this with the 2nd through the second-to-last number in the property’s OID.                                                                                                                                                                                                | B   | O   | Null                 |
| 89  | var | Property OID Remainder This contains the remaining numbers of the Property’s OID, BER TLV encoded per **X.660** section **8 Basic encoding rules**. For details about TLV encoding an OID. To request a set of properties in a branch of the Property OID structure, the host should pass a partial Property OID, and the device returns the value of all properties from the specified tree level downward.  For simplicity, include all numbers except the final number of the property’s OID in **Property Type** and **Property OID Tree Prefix**, and include the final number of the OID OR 0xC0 here, then append constant byte 0x00. These two bytes represent a single empty BER TLV primitive data object. | B   | R   |                      |

| 89  | var | Property OID Remainder This contains the same TLV-encoded portion of the OID the host included in the Property OID Remainder of the request message, with leaf nodes populated with actual values. If the host requested a set of properties in a branch of the Property OID structure, this contains the set of requested branches, including branch OIDs, leaf node IDs, and values.  If the host follows the “for simplicity” recommendation in the request message to request a single property, it can retrieve the value of the requested property by stripping off the first few bytes, which represent the TLV-encoded last number in the OID and the length of the property’s value, as follows; the remaining bytes are the value of the property: If the second byte is 7F or less, strip off the first two bytes. If the second byte is 81, strip off the first three bytes. If the second byte is 82, strip off the first four bytes. | B   | R   | N/A     |

### Command 0xD111 - Set Property (Unsecured)

| ![](Images/03555afcb3177a7ebf5f264c12d86851.png)                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Properties are stored in flash memory, which inherently has a limited number of read-write cycles before it begins to wear. For this reason, MagTek recommends setting properties as few times as possible over the lifecycle of the device. |

The host uses this command to set device configuration / settings that do not
require security. For setting properties that require security see **Command
0xD112 - Set Property (Secured)**.

Each data element representing device configuration is part of a tree of values
and is uniquely identified by an Object Identifier (also known as an Object ID
or OID) as defined in **ITU-T X.660 \| ISO/IEC 9834-1**, which can be found by
searching for **X.660** in the publications on
[www.itu.int](http://www.itu.int). This document refers to these data elements
collectively as **Properties**. The list of all properties and their
corresponding OIDs and other characteristics is provided in section **8
Configuration**.

This command can be used in multiple ways. For simplicity, this document
describes one possible way that does not require detailed knowledge of the
**X.660** specification.

To set a property, the sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host determines which property it wants to set and the value it wants to
    set in the device (see section **8 Configuration**).
2.  The host composes a command request in the format below, and sends it to the
    device.
3.  The device sends a response in the format below. If the request succeeded,
    the response payload is identical to the request payload. If it did not
    succeed, the device returns a failure response with no command-specific
    parameters.

For simplicity, populate this with the 2nd through the second-to-last number in the property’s OID.  This can also be populated with fewer numbers from the OID, in which case the remaining numbers of the OID must be included in the **Property OID Remainder**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | B   | O   | Null                 |
| 89  | var | Property OID Remainder This contains the remaining numbers of the Property’s OID, BER TLV encoded per **X.660** section **8 Basic encoding rules**. For details about TLV encoding an OID.  For simplicity, include all numbers except the final number of the property’s OID in **Property Type** and **Property OID Tree Prefix**, and include the final number of the OID OR 0xC0 here, then append a length corresponding one of the following, then append the value to set the property to: If the length of the value you are setting is 0x7F or shorter, include one byte equal to the length of the value. If the length of the value you are setting is greater than 0x7F but less than 0xFFFF, append 82, then two bytes equal to the length of the value. | B   | R   |                      |

### Command 0xD112 - Set Property (Secured)

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Properties are stored in flash memory, which inherently has a limited number of read-write cycles before it begins to wear. For this reason, MagTek recommends setting properties as few times as possible over the lifecycle of the device. |

The host uses this command to set device configuration / settings securely.
Properties that require security should specify that they do in their
documentation. This command can also be used for properties that do not require
security.

The details, request data and response data of this command are identical to
what is documented in **Command 0xD111 - Set Property (Unsecured),** however,
the command must be structured and sent according to what is documented in
sequence of events 1-5 of **Command 0xD811 - Start Send File to Device
(Secured)**.

### Command 0xD201 - Reset Properties to Defaults (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY FOR NOW)

The host uses this command to reset the device’s Command 0xD201 - Reset
Properties to Defaults (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY FOR NOW) Properties to their
default values. It does not reset configuration values that are set using
**Command 0xD111 - Set Property (Unsecured)** or **Command 0xD112 - Set Property
(Secured)**.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host composes a command request in the format below and sends it to the
    device.
2.  The device resets all properties to the default values specified by the
    command.
3.  The device sends a response in the format below.
4.  The device automatically resets and applies the new settings.

## Command Group 0xD8nn - File Operations

### About Files

Large blobs of data uploaded to / downloaded from the device are referred to as
“files” and share a common set of commands documented here, and special message
type **Data File Message**. Some file types can be sent in the File Payload
fields in “raw” form (e.g. certificates and images) with metadata coming from
the command request and response. Other file types require the addition of
MagTek metadata included inside the File Payload blob; these are documented in
the “File Type” subsections of section **4 Data Types and Shared TLV Data
Objects**.

Files Types that may come from the host include:

-   EMV configuration
-   Firmware updates
-   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certificates
-   User interface images and prompts
-   EMV kernels
-   SRED BIN tables

File Types that may come from the device include:

-   Read back of the above file types
-   Signature Capture
-   Logs
-   Certificate Requests

The commands in this section share a common list of 4-byte file types, listed in
Table. File types marked as Secured = Yes must be loaded using **Command 0xD811
\- Start Send File to Device (Secured)**; file types that are marked as Secured =
No can be loaded using **Command 0xD812 - Start Send File to Device
(Unsecured)**.

### Command 0xD801 - Load Firmware File

The host uses this command to send a firmware image file, signed by MagTek, to
the device as the first step in updating firmware. The host also uses this
command to send a firmware image file, signed by MagTek, to the device as the
first step in updating firmware. If the battery charge is five percent or less,
a response is returned indicating that the command has not been executed. See
**Table 204 - Response Example for Command 0xD801**.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host is assumed to have access to a binary file containing a firmware
    image signed by MagTek, which contains a complete instance of **Firmware
    File Type (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY)**.
2.  The host composes a command request in the format below, using the binary
    file as the **Payload**, and sends it to the device.
3.  The device sends a response to the host in the format below to acknowledge
    it has received the request. The device will not allow the Load Firmware
    File command to execute if the battery charge is 5 percent or lower.
4.  The device validates the request and authenticates the firmware file with
    the algorithm specified in the firmware file payload.

    If the upload was not successful, then go to the next step. If the upload
    was successful and auto-commit was disabled, then go to the next step. Else,
    the device will commit the image automatically. If it was successful, the
    device sends **Notification 0x0905 - Firmware Update Successful** to the
    host. If it was unsuccessful, the device sends **Notification 0x0906 -
    Firmware Update Failed**to the host. Commit Firmware Notification Detail
    Codes are used for auto-commit mode. In both cases, the device automatically
    resets.

### Command 0xD811 - Start Send File to Device (Secured)

The host uses this command to start sending secured files to the device for
storage or processing. It is similar to **Command 0xD812 - Start Send File to
Device (Unsecured)**, but is used to send a different subset of file types that
impact device security and require some form of authentication from the host.
Refer to Table 201 to determine which file type requires a secure command All
files require the command to be authorized via a secure wrapper. In some cases,
files include additional signatures within the file structure itself. This
command is paired with **Command 0xD821 - Start Get File from Device**, which
the host can use to retrieve files. However, some file types are “one way only”
and can not be retrieved using that command after the host sends them to the
device.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host uses **Command 0xE001 - Get Challenge** to establish a secure
    session with the device.
2.  The host determines which file type it will send to the device (see section
    **6.7.1 About Files**), and either opens an existing file in its file system
    for reading, or begins constructing it.
3.  The host constructs **Command 0xD811 - Start Send File to Device (Secured)**
    per **Table 207**.
4.  The host constructs **Command 0xEEEE - Send Secured Command to Device**
    using the previously constructed command as the payload, and sends that
    command to the device as a **Request Message** to start the process of
    uploading a file.
    1.  Use **Command 0xEF11 - Get Key Info** to gather information about the
        key to use to secure the message payload(s). Because this command
        requires a MAC, use key slot 1111.
    2.  Build the **Security Parameters Type** portion of the wrapper with:
        1.  Security Operation Type populated with the following values:
            1.  Operation Type = **Command Authorization Using MAC**
            2.  Operation Algorithm = CMAC
            3.  Operation Cipher=AES-256
            4.  Padding = One and zeros
            5.  **MAC Block Size** with any number
        2.  **Key Information Type** populated with the key information gathered
            earlier.
5.  The device sends a **Response Message** so the host knows it can begin
    sending the file.
6.  The host sends a **Data File Message** to the device. If the device does not
    receive file data within a reasonable period of time, it times out and stops
    listening for the data file.
7.  The device checks to make sure the **File ID** and the length and hash of
    the File Payload match with the values the host specified in this command.
8.  The device repeats the same **Response Message**, this time with the
    **Message Reference Number** set to the same value the host used in the
    **Data File Message**.

### Command 0xD812 - Start Send File to Device (Unsecured)

The host uses this command to start sending unsecured files to the device for
storage or processing. It is similar to **Command 0xD811 - Start Send File to
Device (Secured)** but is used to send a different subset of file types that do
not impact device security, Refer to Table 201 to determine which file type can
use unsecure command This command is paired with **Command 0xD821 - Start Get
File from Device**, which the host can use to retrieve files. However, some file
types are “one way only” and can not be retrieved using that command after the
host sends them to the device.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host determines which file type it will send to the device (see section
    **6.7.1 About Files**), and either opens an existing file in its file system
    for reading, or begins constructing it.
2.  The host constructs **Command 0xD812 - Start Send File to Device
    (Unsecured)** per **Table 211**.
3.  The host sends that command to the device as a **Request Message** to start
    the process of uploading a file.
4.  The device sends a **Response Message** so the host knows it can begin
    sending the file.
5.  The host sends a **Data File Message** to the device. (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY
    FOR NOW) If the device does not receive file data within a reasonable period
    of time, it times out and stops listening for the data file.
6.  The device checks to make sure the **File ID** and the length and hash of
    the **File Payload** match with the values the host specified in this
    command.
7.  The device repeats the same **Response Message**, this time with the
    **Message Reference Number** set to the same value the host used in the
    **Data File Message**.

For image data, the file must be either BMP format or Magtek signed image
format, maximum 320px by 240px, with color depth 16 color, 256 color, 16-bit
color, or 24-bit color. Images smaller than the maximum size are centered on the
display. Maximum size is 160KB per slot, but images can span multiple slots as
shown below. The maximum sizes for each slot are 640KB for slot 1, 480KB for
slot 2, 320KB for slot 3, and 160KB for slot 4. Loading an image that overwrites
any portion of an existing image will delete that image.

### Command 0xD821 - Start Get File from Device

The host uses this command to request a file stored on the device. File types
include standard files (images and certificates), MagTek custom files
(configuration, firmware), and in some cases even large data blob output (such
as signature capture data). In many cases, the files retrieved by this command
have been sent by a host previously using **Command 0xD811 - Start Send File to
Device (Secured)** or **Command 0xD812 - Start Send File to Device
(Unsecured)**. In other cases, such as retrieving signature capture data, the
data may originate with the device and the host uses this command to retrieve
it. Such data and is not persistent, in the sense that the device does not
retain it through power cycles.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host composes a command request in the format below, and sends it to the
    device.
2.  The device sends a response in the format below so the host knows it can
    begin listening for a file message.
3.  The device sends a **Data File Message** to the host. If the host does not
    receive file data within a reasonable period of time, it should time out and
    stop listening for the data file.
4.  Upon receiving the end of the **Data File Message**, the host should check
    to make sure the **File ID**, length, and hash of the **File Payload** in
    the **Data File Message** match the values the device specified in its
    response to ensure the file has not been tampered with.

### Command 0xD825 - Get File Info from Device

The host uses this command to request the file information of a file stored on
the device. File types include standard files (images and certificates), MagTek
custom files (configuration, firmware), and in some cases even large data blob
output (such as signature capture data). In many cases, the file information
retrieved by this command have been sent by a host previously using **Command
0xD811 - Start Send File to Device (Secured)** or **Command 0xD812 - Start Send
File to Device (Unsecured)**. In other cases, such as retrieving file
information of signature capture data, the data may originate with the device
and the host uses this command to retrieve the information. Such information is
not persistent, in the sense that the device does not retain it through power

### Command 0xDF02 - Convert Binary Tag Data to Text (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY FOR NOW)

Reserved for future use per Dave.

## Command Group 0xEnnn - Security

### Command 0xE001 - Get Challenge

The host uses this command to request challenge data from the device, which the
host can then use to perform a specific sensitive operation / modify a specific
type of device setting. Information about how the host should pass the required
challenge data to the device is included in the documentation for all commands
that use this security mechanism.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host already wants to perform a secured operation that requires a
    challenge [for example **Command 0xEEEE - Send Secured Command to Device**].
2.  The host constructs the command request for **Command 0xE001 - Get
    Challenge** in the format below.
3.  The host sends the command request to the device.
4.  The device generates a random number for the challenge, stores it locally,
    and sends a response in the format below to the host.
5.  The device starts a 5 minute countdown timer during which the challenge is
    valid. If the host takes no action within 5 minutes, the timer expires, the
    device erases the challenge data, and the device must retrieve a fresh
    challenge to perform the operation it wants to perform. This binding of the
    command to a specific time period allows the device to detect and reject
    commands that have been captured/intercepted at one point in time and
    replayed later.

### Command 0xEEEE - Send Secured Command to Device

The host uses this command to transmit another command securely. This “secure
wrapper” mechanism provides the device a means to ensure the wrapped command
originated from an authentic, authorized host. In addition, its implementation
includes an operation that starts a countdown timer, which ensures the command
is current and is not an unauthorized replay of a previously intercepted /
stored command. This command can use multiple authentication methods, including
MAC or ECDSA Signature. The method and parameters to use are specific to the
command being wrapped, and are specified in the documentation for that command.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host determines what command it wants to call from section **6
    Commands**, determines the command must be secured, and uses the Request
    Data table for that command to compose **Message Payload**.
2.  The host uses **Command 0xE001 - Get Challenge** to retrieve a **Challenge
    Token** and unlock the device for receiving the desired command for a
    limited period of time. When the time expires, the device will no longer
    accept the Challenge Token and the host will have to retrieve another one.
3.  The host creates an instance of **Command 0xEEEE - Send Secured Command to
    Device** in the format below, and includes the Message Payload and Challenge
    Token inside it. In the **Request Message**, it fills in **Command ID** as
    the command number of the wrapped Message Payload, instead of 0xEEEE. Some
    parameters are command-specific; see the documentation for the command that
    is being wrapped to determine what values to use.
4.  The host sends the resulting composite command request to the device.
5.  The device validates the serial number and challenge token, then examines
    the parameters to determine which authentication method is being used, and
    authenticates the command accordingly.
6.  If the device determines the command request is authentic, it will start
    executing the secure command defined by the Message Payload.
7.  The device sends a response to the host reporting success or failure. In
    both cases, the response uses the format that corresponds to the command
    invoked by the Message Payload. See the documentation for that command to
    determine the format of the response.

### Command 0xEF01 - Load Key Using TR-31

The host uses this command to load a key into one of several available slots in
the device’s secure memory.

To inject a specific key in the above table, the corresponding Load TK shall be
injected previously

As shown in the table, MTK injection requires that a TMPTK has been created. See
**Command 0xF017 - Establish Ephemeral KBPK**.

After MTK has been injected successfully, the sequence of injecting other keys
is as follows:

1.  The host uses **Command 0xE001 - Get Challenge** to establish a secure
    session with the device.
2.  The host constructs a TR-31 (X9.143) key block for the key it is going to
    load. (Note that the Load Key must be injected previously.)
3.  The host constructs the command request for **Command 0xEF01 - Load Key
    Using TR-31** in the format below.
4.  The host sends the command request to the device.
5.  The device sends a response in the format below to the host.

### Command 0xEF02 – Generate CSR keys (WLAN Only)

The host uses this command to generate a key pair to be used for a certificate
signing request (CSR). The key pair generated will be 256 bit elliptic-curve
(EC) keys. The key pair generated will be saved to non-volatile memory in the
device and will overwrite any existing CSR key pair. The key pair will persist
in non-volatile memory associated with a CSR until it is either overwritten or
until a leaf certificate is loaded into the device with **Command 0xD811 - Start
Send File to Device (Secured)** that contains a public key that matches the key
pair at which point the key pair will be associated with that certificate
instead of a CSR.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host constructs the command request in the format below and sends it to
    the device.
2.  The device sends a response in the format below to the host to indicate that
    key pair generation has been started.
3.  Once the device finishes generating the key pair, it will send
    **Notification 0x1001 - Device Information Update** with the category set to
    key management and the reason set to CSR keys generated to indicate that the
    key pair generation process has completed. The device typically takes around
    a second or two to generate a 256 bit EC key pair. If this command is
    extended in the future to support 2048 bit RSA keys, then it will take an
    average of 30 seconds and sometimes much longer to generate the RSA keys.
    That is why a notification is used to indicate that the key pair has been
    generated instead of a command response that indicates that it is complete.
4.  The host will typically send **Command 0xEF03 – Generate CSR (WLAN Only)**
    as the next step. See this command for more detail and more potential steps.

### Command 0xEF03 – Generate CSR (WLAN Only)

The host uses this command to generate a certificate signing request (CSR) in
PEM format. The CSR generated will be saved to volatile memory in the device and
will overwrite any existing CSR. The CSR will persist in volatile memory until
it is overwritten, fetched with **Command 0xD821 - Start Get File from Device**
or the device is power cycled or reset.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host will use **Command 0xEF02 – Generate CSR keys (WLAN Only)** if it
    wants generate a CSR using a new CSR key pair.
2.  The host constructs the command request in the format below and sends it to
    the device.
3.  The device sends a response in the format below to the host to indicate that
    CSR generation has completed.
4.  The host fetches the CSR with **Command 0xD821 - Start Get File from
    Device.**
5.  The CSR is used to create a certificate.
6.  The host loads the certificate into the device with **Command 0xD811 - Start
    Send File to Device (Secured)**.

### Command 0xEF09 – Encrypt User Data

The host uses this command to request that the device encrypt a block of user
data embedded in the command string. The SRED ID 2 Key will be used for
encryption. The TLVs of KSN and Encryption Type will be provided at the end of
the string for decryption.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host composes a command request in the format below and sends it to the
    device.
2.  The device will fetch the Real-Time Clock Date/Timestamp, retrieve the
    device's Serial Number, extract the data within 0xA3 TLV in the command
    string. And then concatenate all the collected TLVs as follows: \<RTC TLV\>
    \+ \<Device SN TLV\> + \<User Data TLV(s)\>. The format of the encrypted data
    string is shown in the Response Data below.
3.  If the command is invalid or encryption fails, then a response of failure
    will be sent to the host.

### Command 0xEF11 - Get Key Info

The host uses this command to retrieve information about a key slot, including
details about the key stored in that slot. It can be used for several purposes,
including:

-   Determine if a key exists / has been loaded
-   Get key derivation data to derive a DUKPT key
-   Get transport key information to retrieve the appropriate transport key

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host constructs the command request in the format below.
2.  The host sends the command request to the device.
3.  The device sends a response in the format below to the host.

## Command Group 0xFnnn - Manufacturing

### Command 0xF012 - Force Tamper (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY)

This command is used to force the device’s tamper protection mechanisms to
register a tamper event.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The device’s tamper protection features must first be enabled. See **Command
    0xF016 - Activate Device Security (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY)**.
2.  The host uses **Command 0xE001 - Get Challenge** to establish a secure
    session with the device.
3.  The host constructs the command request for **Command 0xF012 - Force Tamper
    (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY)** in the format below.
4.  The host constructs **Command 0xEEEE - Send Secured Command to Device**
    using the previously constructed command request as the payload, and sends
    that command request to the device as a **Request Message**.
    1.  Because this command is secured using a signature, read **Property
        2.1.2.2.2.6 Key Type** to determine which fixed key to use to generate
        the signature.
    2.  Build the **Security Parameters Type** portion of the wrapper with:
        1.  Table 46 - Encrypted Signature Capture File Type populated with the
            following values:
            1.  Operation Type = **Command Authorization Using Signature**
            2.  Operation Algorithm = **ECDSA (indeterministic)**
            3.  Operation Hash = **SHA-256**
            4.  Operation Curve = **P521**.
5.  The device validates the request:
    1.  If the request is valid and properly authenticated, it forces the tamper
        event and automatically resets. The device does not send a response to
        the host in this case.
    2.  If the request fails validation, the device sends a response in the
        format below to report the failure to the host.

### Command 0xF014 - Read Log (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY)

The host uses this command to read the system event log from the device.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host uses **Command 0xE001 - Get Challenge** to establish a secure
    session with the device.
2.  The host constructs the command request for **Tamper in** the format below.
3.  The host constructs **Command 0xEEEE - Send Secured Command to Device**
    using the previously constructed command request as the payload, and sends
    that command request to the device as a **Request Message**.
    1.  Because this command is secured using a signature, read **Property
        2.1.2.2.2.6 Key Type** to determine which fixed key to use to generate
        the signature.
    2.  Build the **Security Parameters Type** portion of the wrapper with:
        1.  Table 46 - Encrypted Signature Capture File Type populated with the
            following values:
            1.  Operation Type = **Command Authorization Using Signature**
            2.  Operation Algorithm = **ECDSA (indeterministic)**
            3.  Operation Hash = **SHA-256**
            4.  Operation Curve = **P521**.
            5.  The device validates the request, then read the system event
                log. The device sends a response in the format below to report
                the result to the host.

Each Event Log text block can contain one of several human readable strings
describing the event. The following is an example of two log entries indicating
Forced Tamper:

2023-12-08 02:57 @ID:0, sensor_status=0x1, active_sensors=0xaa0374

2023-12-08 02:57 @ID:0, tamper_time_in_seconds=1702004228

In the first log entry above:

-   The value after **sensor_status=** is a 32-bit hex encoded number with a bit
    set to 1 for each tamper sensor that registered an actual tamper event.
-   The value after **active_sensors =** is a 32-bit hex encoded number with a
    bit set to 1 for each tamper sensor that was active when the device logged
    the tamper event.
-   The bit values for both numbers are listed in **Table 297 below**.

In the second log entry above, the value after **tamper_time_in_seconds=** is
the value of the device’s real time clock at the time the tamper occurred,
expressed as a decimal a number of seconds in Unix epoch time format. This is
expected to differ from the human readable date-time stamp that indicates when
the device wrote the event to the log, because the device’s always-active
security subsystem registers a basic but indelible version of the tamper event
immediately, whereas the logging subsystem may need to wait for the device to
automatically reboot after tamper, or wait to be powered up after a powered-off
tamper, before system resources are available to write the event to the log.

### Command 0xF015 - Read Log & Clear Tamper (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY)

The host uses this command to clear the device’s tamper status and read the
system event log from the device.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host uses **Command 0xE001 - Get Challenge** to establish a secure
    session with the device.
2.  The host constructs the command request for **Command 0xF015 - Read Log &
    Clear Tamper** in the format below.
3.  The host constructs **Command 0xEEEE - Send Secured Command to Device**
    using the previously constructed command request as the payload, and sends
    that command request to the device as a **Request Message**.
    1.  Because this command is secured using a signature, read **Property
        2.1.2.2.2.6 Key Type** to determine which fixed key to use to generate
        the signature.
    2.  Build the **Security Parameters Type** portion of the wrapper with:

        Table 46 - Encrypted Signature Capture File Type populated with the
        following values:

        1.  Operation Type = **Command Authorization Using Signature**
            1.  Operation Algorithm = **ECDSA (indeterministic)**
            2.  Operation Hash = **SHA-256**
            3.  Operation Curve = **P521**.
            4.  The device validates the request, then does the following:
            5.  Read and clear the system event log.
            6.  Clear the device’s tamper status.
            7.  Check the device’s tamper status.
            8.  The device sends a response in the format below to report the
                result to the host. If the request started successfully, the
                Request Status in the message wrapper is OK, Started / Running,
                All good / requested operation was successful. If the device is
                still in a tampered state after it clears the tamper, the
                response reports a failure.

| /null | (var) | Event Log This text blob contains the specified **Number of Events**, up to 10 events total, of constant length equal to **Length of Each Event**. If there are any empty events, they are filled with 0x00 (Null). Each non-null contains: 20 bytes of human readable date-time indicating when the device wrote the entry into the log. If the device is powered on when a tamper occurs, it records the event, reboots, then writes the event to the log. If the device is powered off when a tamper occurs, it records the event, then write the event to the log the next time it powers on.

End of any wrappers, at minimum including **Response Message** found on page

Each **Event Log** text block can contain one of several human readable strings
describing the event. The following is an example of two log entries indicating
**Tamper Pin 3 Input** tampered:

2021-02-05 00:16 @ID:0, sensor_status=0x80001, active_sensors =0xaa0374

2021-02-05 00:16 @ID:0, tamper_time_in_seconds=1612484188

In the first log entry above:

-   The value after **sensor_status=** is a 32-bit hex encoded number with a bit
    set to 1 for each tamper sensor that registered an actual tamper event.
-   The value after **active_sensors =** is a 32 bit hex encoded number with a
    bit set to 1 for each tamper sensor that was active when the device logged
    the tamper event.
-   The bit values for both numbers are listed in **Table 297 below**.

In the second log entry above, the value after **tamper_time_in_seconds=** is
the value of the device’s real time clock at the time the tamper occurred,
expressed as a decimal a number of seconds in Unix epoch time format. This is
expected to differ from the human readable date-time stamp that indicates when
the device wrote the event to the log, because the device’s always-active
security subsystem registers a basic but indelible version of the tamper event
immediately, whereas the logging subsystem may need to wait for the device to
automatically reboot after tamper, or wait to be powered up after a powered-off
tamper, before system resources are available to write the event to the log.

### Command 0xF016 - Activate Device Security (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY)

The host uses this command to activate the security on the device. This allows
the manufacturer to perform initial operations on an unsecured device, then
enable security before shipping. This command is intended to only be executed
once during manufacturing, and can not be undone or redone.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host uses **Command 0xE001 - Get Challenge** to establish a secure
    session with the device.
2.  The host constructs a request for **Command 0xF016 - Activate Device
    Security** as shown below.
3.  The host constructs **Command 0xEEEE - Send Secured Command to Device**
    using the previously constructed command request as the payload, and sends
    that command request to the device as a **Request Message**.
    1.  Because this command is secured using a signature, read **Property
        2.1.2.2.2.6 Key Type** to determine which fixed key to use to generate
        the signature.
    2.  Build the **Security Parameters Type** portion of the wrapper with:
        1.  **Table 46 - Encrypted Signature Capture File Type** populated with
            the following values:
            1.  Operation Type = **Command Authorization Using Signature**
            2.  Operation Algorithm = **ECDSA (indeterministic)**
            3.  Operation Hash = **SHA-256**
            4.  Operation Curve = **P521**.
4.  The device does the following:
    1.  Validates the secure wrapper around the command and terminates if the
        signature is invalid.
    2.  Set the specified date and time on the device’s real-time clock (RTC).
    3.  Store the specified PCI Hardware ID in the device’s battery backed
        secure RAM.
    4.  Store the specified Hardware Configuration Profile in the device’s
        battery backed secure RAM.
    5.  Store the specified MAC Address in the device’s battery backed secure
        RAM.
    6.  Enable the 23-hour automatic restart.
    7.  Generate the Master Key Derivation Key (MKDK) and four Derived Key
        Encrypting Keys (DKEK/DDEK/DKMK/DDMK).
    8.  Store the specified WLAN SoftAP MagTek Password in the device’s EEPROM
        AES 256 CBC encrypted using the DKEK.
    9.  Activate and lock the tamper protection mechanism.
5.  The device sends a **Response Message** to the host to indicate the result.

| 86     | var  | Hardware Configuration Profile This parameter contains a tightly encoded block of bytes that tells the device’s firmware what hardware is installed. Note some values inside this parameter must be prefixed with explicit lengths, but for compactness they do not include tags. Such values do not have parentheses in the **Len** column. This data is stored in the secure processor’s battery-backed (VBAT) Register File and, like keys, can only be erased by forcing a tamper event.  Example: 02 05 01 02 01 02 00 04 01 01 01 01 02 01 01 05 01 00 00 00 01 05 01 01 01 01 01 | B   | O   |         |

### Command 0xF017 - Establish Ephemeral KBPK

The host uses this command to complete the **ECDHE-ECDSA Key Exchange**
protocol, which enables the host and the device to generate the same TEMP KBPK
key to use with **Command 0xEF01 - Load Key Using TR-31** to load the Master
Transport Key (MTK).

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  The host uses **Command 0xE001 - Get Challenge** to establish a secure
    session with the device.
2.  The host constructs **Command 0xF017 - Establish Ephemeral KBPK** per the
    request table below.
3.  The host constructs **Command 0xEEEE - Send Secured Command to Device**
    using the previously constructed command request as the payload, and sends
    that command request to the device as a **Request Message**.
    1.  Because this command is secured using a signature, read **Property
        2.1.2.2.2.6 Key Type** to determine which fixed key to use to generate
        the signature.
    2.  Build the **Security Parameters Type** portion of the wrapper with:
        1.  **Table 46 - Encrypted Signature Capture File Type** Operation Type
            = **Command Authorization Using Signature**
            1.  Operation Algorithm = **ECDSA (indeterministic)**
            2.  Operation Hash = **SHA-256**
            3.  Operation Curve = **P521**.
4.  The device does the following:
    1.  Validates the secure wrapper around the command, and terminates if the
        signature is invalid.
    2.  Determine if the Master Transport Key (MTK) has already been loaded. If
        it has, the device rejects the command request.
    3.  Generates a pair of keys, saves the Device Private Key for calculation.
    4.  Generates and saves 8 bytes of Device Random Token for calculation.
    5.  Calculates the TEMP KBPK based on Host Public Key and Host Random Token
        passed in with the command request, and the Device Private Key and
        Device Random Token the device generated.
5.  The device sends a **Response Message** to the host to indicate the result.
    The response message includes Device Random Token and Device Public Key.
6.  The host calculates a matching TEMP KBPK as defined in as defined in **NIST
    SP800-56A**, using the Host Private Key, Host Random Token, Device Public
    Key, and Device Random Token. It can then use this key to perform encryption
    operations on secret data in the Master Transport Key (MTK).
7.  The device uses its copy of the matching TEMP KBPK to decrypt the secret
    information encrypted by the host using the same key. On successful MTK
    load, the device erases the TEMP KBPK. It also erases the TEMP KBPK if the
    device is power cycled or reset, and the host would need to restart the
    process with a new TEMP KBPK.

# Notifications

This section provides definitions and practical information about **Notification
Message**s, which follow the format described in section **3.2.2.3**. To find
documentation about a specific notification:

1.  Use the **Notification Source** byte in the message to find the Notification
    Source subsection below. For example, Notification Source **0x01
    Transaction** leads to subsection **7.1 Notification Source 0x01nn -
    Notifications from Transactions**.
2.  Within that subsection, use the **Notification Source** byte plus the
    **Notification Type** byte in the message to find the Notification
    subsection. For example, Notification Source **0x01 Transaction** plus
    Notification Type **0x01 Information Update** leads to **Notification 0x0101
    \- Transaction Information Update**.
3.  Within that subsection, use the four bytes of **Notification Detail Code**
    in the message to look up the notification in the **Notification Detail
    Code** table. For example, **0x07080302** leads to a row in **Table 308**
    that provides practical information about what event led to the
    notification, and how to interpret the Notification Payload.

## Notification Source 0x01nn - Notifications from Transactions

### Notification 0x0101 - Transaction Information Update

This notification reports information about progress and state changes that
occur during a transaction.

For this notification, **Notification Detail** described in section **3.2.2.3
Notification Message** contains one byte each, shown in **Table 308**, to
indicate:

-   The **Payment Technology** (PT) involved
-   The **Reason** (Rsn) for the notification
-   **Detail** (Det) about the notification that has different meanings
    depending on the Reason, and
-   An **Extra** field (Ext) that has different meanings depending on the
    Reason.

This notification reports information about general state changes that occur
within the device, outside the context of specific operations like transactions
(**Notification Source 0x01nn - Notifications from Transactions**), requests the
host receives from the firmware’s integrated display interface (**Notification
Source 0x18nn - Notifications from User Interface**), and so on.

For this notification, **Notification Detail** described in section **3.2.2.3
Notification Message** contains one byte each, shown in **Table 331** **below**,
to indicate:

-   The **Category** (Cat) of notification (for example, the subsystem the
    notification is originating from)
-   The **Reason** (Rsn) for the notification (Device Event)
-   **Detail** (Det) about the notification that has different meanings
    depending on the Reason, and
-   An **Extra** field (Ext) that has different meanings depending on the
    Reason.

The other optional message parameters in the **Notification Message** depend on
which combination of four bytes is included in **Notification Detail**, and are
described in **Table 331**.

| Category **0x01 User Event** contains notification detail codes involving events triggered by user actions. Each possible notification has a unique **Reason** value: Reason 0x00 = Contactless Card Presented (EMV Contactless Only) Reason 0x01 = Contactless Card Removed (EMV Contactless Only) Reason 0x02 = Card Seated in Slot (EMV Contact Only) Reason 0x03 = Card Unseated from Slot (EMV Contact Only) Reason 0x04 = Card Swiped (MSR Only) Reason 0x05 = Touch Sensor Press On Display (Touch Only) Reason 0x06 = Touch Sensor Release On Display (Touch Only) Reason 0x07 = Barcode Read (BCR Only)  The host can use **Property 1.2.7.1.2.1 User Event Notification Controls** Enable to enable these notification reasons individually.  The host may choose to use these notifications to determine when to send additional commands. For example, it may send **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction**. The host should do this as quickly as possible to minimize the response time between when the cardholder presents a card and when the device provides feedback via a visible or audible state change or attempts to read a chip card. Note there are cases where the device may send a notification with **Reason** = **Contactless Card Presented** while the cardholder is inserting or swiping a card, so the host should start transactions with all supported card interfaces enabled to maximize the chances of a successful card read. |
| Category **0x02 Session Management** contains notification detail codes involving session management functionality (Session Management Only).

# Configuration

## About Configuration

The device provides two mechanisms for the host to retrieve information about
the device and to configure / customize device behavior:

-   **Properties** are smaller configuration values (generally up to 255 bytes
    and often significantly smaller). The device stores properties in a
    hierarchical tree, where each property has its own unique ID (sometimes
    referred to as an Object Identifier or OID) that identifies its position in
    the tree. The host can set and get properties using the commands in Command
    Group 0xD1nn - Settings and Information. For further information about OIDs,
    see **Appendix A Object IDs (OIDs) and ITU-T X660**.
-   **Files** are larger configuration values, which include custom graphics
    files and large configuration data blobs such as EMV terminal and
    application settings. Each file has a unique identifier more akin to a file
    path in a file system. The host can set and get files using the commands in
    **Command Group 0xD8nn - File Operations**.

This section focuses on **properties**, which the host can either read from the
device to retrieve device information (such as its PCI hardware ID, serial
number, firmware revision numbers, etc.), or write to the device to change
device behavior, or to store values for future reference.

Property unique IDs represent a tree structure, where each property is at the
“leaf” level of the tree. Some operations allow the host to work with entire
groups of properties (branches or even the trunk containing all its leaves) by
using a property number representing a higher level of the tree.

Each property (a “leaf” in the tree) is described in a subsection below,
including whether it can be written to, how it is secured, how to construct or
interpret its value(s), and how it affects device behavior.

To reflect this hierarchy, this section of the document groups settings by major
categories that correspond to the tree structure, which roughly breaks down into
overall property **type**, **module**, and **submodule**.

| Description          | The device uses this property to control its ARPC Retry Attempts. If a timeout occurs when the device is waiting for the host to send **Command 0x1004 - Resume Transaction** with ARPC data, the device re-sends **Notification 0x0101 - Transaction Information Update** to report **ARQC Update** and waits for ARPC data again, up to the number of retries specified by this property. After the final retry, the device continues with the transaction. |

| Description          | This property specifies a list of tags to be included in the encrypted portion of the ARQC and batch data (0xDFDF59/0xFC).  For EMV transactions, any tags not present in this list will not appear encrypted in the ARQC/batch data but will instead be included in the cleartext portion of the ARQC (0xF9/0xFA/0x70) and batch data (F9/F2). For MSR transactions, the behavior is the same but there's an additional property that specifies which tags to include in cleartext (**Property 1.1.1.1.5.3 MSR Cleartext Tag List**). For MSR transactions, only tags that are present in that list will appear in cleartext. |

When the device sends masked track data, it replaces some characters in the
track data with a specified mask character. The specific characters the device
masks depends on the card encode type. The device only selectively masks data
that came from ISO/ABA cards (Financial Cards with **ISO/IEC 7813** Format code
B); it sends data from all other card types entirely unmasked.

The device masks all fields from ISO/ABA cards except a number of configurable
leading and trailing characters of the PAN. See **Property 1.1.2.2.1.3 PAN
Number of Leading Unmasked Characters** and **Property 1.1.2.2.1.4 PAN Number of
Trailing Unmasked Characters**.

For chip card transactions, masked track 2 data is contained in TLV data object
DFDF4D. For magnetic stripe transactions, masked track 1, 2 and 3 data is
contained in TLV data objects DFDF31, DFDF33 and DFDF35, respectively.

**Table 533** **below** provides an example of data from tracks 1, 2, and 3 of
an ISO/ABA card after it has been decrypted or if the device has sent it in the
clear. **Table 534** shows the same data as it might appear with a specific set
of masking rules applied.

| Description          | The device uses this property to determine whether it should modify one of the masked PAN digits such that the masked PAN passes the Luhn MOD-10 algorithm check. If this property is enabled, the device uses masking character ‘0’ to mask the PAN, regardless of the setting in **Property 1.1.2.2.1.2 ISO/ABA Masking Character**, and masks the remainder of the track data with the configured masking character. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to determine whether to use the Luhn MOD-10 algorithm to validate card number (PAN) digits a cardholder or operator enters in manual card entry mode during **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction**. If validation is enabled, the device checks the PAN digits during entry, and until the PAN passes the check, the device disables the ENTER key, sounds an error tone when the Enter key is pressed (if the command has audio feedback enabled), and stays at the Card Number prompt until the cardholder or operator presses the Cancel button or corrects the PAN. |

| Description          | The host can use this property to enable Selectable Card Data Encryption. Each bit enables a specific card data encryption by setting that bit to 1. Byte 0 is the first byte, bit 0 is the LSB of each byte. This is a secured OID, the set request shall be from 0xD112 command. If the Key DKPTM1F has not been injected, enabling any bits in this OID will return failure response status 80-02-05-27 (TR31 errors, Key not present). If the Key DKPTM1F becomes unavailable after this OID has been enabled, then this OID will be reset to 0 as a status indicator. |
| Securing Key         | Refer to 0xD112 Command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Valid Values         | 0x00 –Card Preference.  The device automatically chooses the application that is mutually supported by the card and the terminal, based on the priority order specified by the card. This is the default and is standard EMV transaction flow behavior.  0x01 – Reserved 0x02 – Reserved  0x03 – Enhanced Prompt Cardholder. The device sends the host **Notification 0x1803 – 02 02 00 00** (Display Cardholder, Data Attached, Reserved) to request that the cardholder select from a list of available applications. Each application may include additional tags such as - priority indicator, Issuer Country Code and Issuer Identification Number. After the cardholder selects an application, the host passes the selection to the device using **Command 0x1802 - Report Cardholder Selection** to device to return the cardholder’s selection to the device.    Note that if the device is configured to use this option, the cardholder must hold the card or contactless payment device in contact with the device for until cardholder application selection is complete, otherwise the device will report the transaction failed. For this reason, MagTek does not recommend using this setting. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to set password for WLAN settings. If the password is shorter than 63 bytes, all remaining bytes after the password should be set to zeros.   For EAP-PEAP authentication, the maximum length of password is 32 bytes. The real password has to be \<= 32 bytes, all bytes after the desired password must be set to zeroes.  For security, the Get request for this property will always return a value with 63 zeroes, so you can only set the password and not get it.  |

| Description          | The device uses this property to determine how many clients it will allow to connect to its WLAN WebSocket server at one time. Most use cases will only want to allow one client at a time. If more than one client is connected, all outgoing data from the device will be sent to all clients. For example, all notifications and all command responses will be sent to all clients. If more than one client is connected, any client can send a command to the device at any time. Since having more than one client send commands to the device at the same time can result in command collisions and unexpected device behavior, it is recommended that only one client be in charge of sending commands and that other clients only listen to outgoing messages. A use case for allowing more than once client may be to have a second client for diagnostic or monitoring purposes.  **Property 2.1.2.5.6.4 Active Client Connections** is related. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to determine if its web application is enabled. The web app can be used to send commands to the device over the WLAN interface using a web browser. The web app appears as a web page on a browser.   The URL and port used to access the web page depend on how the device is configured. The default port is 26 (not 80 or 443). See **Property 1.2.2.1.1.F Web App Port** for changing the web app port. The security required to access the web page depends on if the device has been configured to use TLS or not.  https://df-b62b3aa.lan:26 and https://192.168.86.31:26 are examples of how to access the web page on a device that has TLS enabled. http://df-b62b3aa.lan:26 and http://192.168.86.31:26 are examples of how to access the web page on a device that does not have TLS enabled.  If this property is changed, the device must be or power cycled or reset before the change will take effect. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to determine which port the web app can be accessed on. See **Web App Enabled** for more details about the web app.   The device does not support having both WLAN web socket and the web app accessible on the same port. By default, the device will use port 443 for the WLAN web socket port when TLS is enabled and port 80 when TLS is not enabled. If the web app port is set to the same port configured for the WLAN web socket port, then the web app will not be accessible.  If this property is changed, the device must be power cycled or reset before the change will take effect. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to determine whether it should reduce its power consumption when a USB host directs it to suspend. If this property is set to Disabled, the device will not have a USB compliant current draw when suspended, which, for example, allows it to continue to turn on LEDs and the display if present.  To activate changes made to this property, the device must be reset or power cycled. |

USB HID devices can communicate with most hosts except for Apple hosts. USB iAP2 devices can communicate to Apple hosts like iPads and iPhones. The behavior affects USB enumeration and communications.  To activate changes made to this property, the device must be reset or power cycled.                                                                                                   |

| Valid Values         | 0x00 = HID only 0x01 = iAP2 only 0x02 = autodetect (iAP2 with HID fallback) The autodetect option can allow a device to work with iAP2 hosts and HID hosts. With this option, every time the device is attached to a USB host it will first enumerate as an iAP2 device, if the device does not receive an iAP2 initialization sequence response from the host within 2 seconds the device will perform a soft USB detach from the host and then a soft USB attach and next enumerate as a USB HID device. |

| Description          | This property contains the Bluetooth® device name, which is typically used by the host software to present an operator with a list of devices to interact with. To avoid ambiguity, if the solution specifies that more than one device of the same name will be available, MagTek recommends including a unique identifier in the device name so the operator can differentiate. The name should not contain any null string characters (0x00) at the beginning or in the middle, 0x00 can be used at the end of the name for padding to a total length of 20 characters. When setting this property, you can enter 0 to 20 characters. If set to a length of 0, the value reverts to its original default value described below. After modifying the Bluetooth® device name, you must reset the Bluetooth® LE module.  When getting this property, device will always return 20 characters If the name is less than 20 characters long, device will return 0x00 for the remaining characters. |

| Default              | A prefix, such as “DF II Go-“ for DynaFlex II Go, followed by the device’s serial number. For example, “DF II Go-B603226”.  Devices are always deployed with the serial number loaded, but prior to loading the serial number at MagTek, the prefix will be followed by the second to last and the last least significant bytes of the Bluetooth® device address converted to ASCII hex. For example, “DF II Go-97C2”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Description          | This two property, in most significant byte order, contains the device’s minimum Bluetooth® LE advertising interval in 625 microsecond increments. This property, combined with **Property 1.2.2.3.1.8 Bluetooth® LE Maximum Advertising Interval,** specifies the Bluetooth® LE advertising interval the device uses. Smaller advertising intervals cause the device to consume more power when advertising, which may be a concern when running on battery power.  Only values between 32 (20ms) and 65535 (40.96s) are valid. The host may need to adjust the maximum advertising interval property when changing this property; if the maximum advertising interval is less than the minimum, the device may behave unpredictably.  After the host changes this property, the device must be reset before the changes will take effect.  |

| Description          | This two-byte property, in most significant byte order, contains the device’s maximum Bluetooth® LE advertising interval in 625 microsecond increments. This property, combined with **Interval, specifies** the Bluetooth® LE advertising interval the device uses. Smaller advertising intervals cause the device to consume more power when advertising, which may be a concern when running on battery power.  Only values between 32 (20ms) and 65535 (40.96s) are valid. The host may need to adjust the minimum advertising interval property when changing this property. If the minimum advertising interval is greater than the maximum, the device may behave unpredictably.  After the host changes this property, the device must be reset before the changes will take effect.  |

| Description          | This six-byte property contains the device’s Bluetooth® passkey as a six-character with valid value for each character between ‘0’ and ‘9’  After the host changes this property, the device must be reset before the changes will take effect.  For security, the Get request for this property will always return a length of zero and no value, so you can only set the passkey and not get it.  |

| Description          | The device uses this property to determine if Bluetooth® LE FCC test mode is enabled and to control it. FCC test mode is only used by MagTek for FCC testing. When it is enabled, the device sends packets continuously with a fixed interval and all other Bluetooth® LE communications are disabled.  If the value of this property is set between 0 and 39 (0x27) FCC test mode is enabled and the value is the transmit channel C. The transmit frequency is (2C + 2402) Mhz. If the value is greater than 39 (0x27) then FCC test mode is disabled.  After the host changes this property, the device must be reset before the changes will take effect. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to determine if Bluetooth® LE Sleep is enabled. When it is enabled, the device will conserve battery power when USB power is not present and the device is not in a secure Bluetooth® LE connection with notifications enabled (not able to exchange messages with a host). The device will conserve battery power by turning off various hardware features and by going into low power modes.  The battery life when the device is idle can be increased by about 3 times for DynaFlex II Go when the host application takes advantage of this feature.  Here is an example of how the host application can be written to take advantage of this feature and extend battery life.  1) Establish a BLE connection with the device only when the host needs to perform a transaction or other operation. 2) Perform the transaction or other operation. 3) Close the BLE connection. 4) The device will sleep at this point and use less power.   Some operations in addition to connecting USB power or establishing a BLE connection will wake the device from sleep mode temporarily. The following are examples of these operations. 1) Pressing the button. 2) Putting the device into pairing mode.  When the device is sleeping, all LEDs will go off so the device will look similar to when it is off.  If the value of this property is set to 0, sleep is disabled. If it is set to 1, sleep is enabled.  After the host changes this property, the device must be reset before the changes will take effect. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to determine if Bluetooth® LE Debug Mode is enabled. When it is enabled, the secure connections bonding uses known debug keys, so that the encrypted packet can be opened by a Bluetooth® protocol analyzer. Bondings made in debug mode are unsecure. This mode should only be enabled for debugging for development purposes and not for regular device use.  Prior to enabling or disabling Debug Mode, the following should be done. Erase all of the device's bonds with **Command 0x1F05 – Erase All Bluetooth® LE Bonds (Bluetooth® LE Only)**. Forget the device on all hosts that have paired with it by using the host's Bluetooth® settings application. Reboot all of those hosts.  Some hosts like Windows 10 will not pair with devices that use known debug keys.  If the value of this property is set to 0, Debug Mode is disabled. If it is set to 1, Debug Mode is enabled.  After the host changes this property, the device must be reset before the changes will take effect. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to set which custom image it displays when idle. If the selected image does not exist, the device falls back to showing text. This property does not take effect instantly; it takes effect the next time the device transitions to idle (for example, after a transaction or after resetting).  0x00 = Show text “Welcome” 0x01 = Show custom image 1 0x02 = Show custom image 2 0x03 = Show custom image 3 0x04 = Show custom image 4  To use this feature, the host must first load an image into the selected slot using **Command 0xD812 - Start Send File to Device (Unsecured)**.

| Description          | The device uses this property to set which custom image it displays when idle and locked. If the selected image does not exist, the device falls back to showing text. This property does not take effect instantly; it takes effect the next time the device transitions to idle (for example, after a transaction or after resetting). See **Device Lock Feature** for more information.  0x00 = Show text “Welcome” “Device is Locked” 0x01 = Show custom image 1 0x02 = Show custom image 2 0x03 = Show custom image 3 0x04 = Show custom image 4  To use this feature, the host must first load an image into the selected slot using **Command 0xD812 - Start Send File to Device (Unsecured)**. Images must be BMP format, 160KB or smaller with no compression, maximum 320px by 240px, with color depth 16 color, 256 color, 16-bit color, 24-bit color. Images smaller than the maximum size are centered on the display. Note images at full screen size must be 16-bit color or lower to meet the size requirement. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to set the orientation of the display. There are four modes: Landscape with magnetic stripe reader (MSR) on the top, Landscape with MSR on the bottom, Portrait with MSR on the right, and Portrait with MSR on the left. This property does not take effect immediately, it takes effect the next time the device transitions to idle (for example, after a transaction or after power cycle / reset). |

| Description          | This property sets the output volume for all sounds the device produces after startup, expressed as a percentage range from 0% (no sound) to 100%. The volume setting takes effect immediately after the host changes it.  Note that devices with limited volume control hardware allocate ranges of numbers to represent the same physical volume level (for example, 1..49 = Low, 50..100 = High). |

| Description          | This property can be used to get or set the device lock state. Getting this property does not require security, however setting it does. Setting it requires the use of **Command 0xD112 - Set Property (Secured)** which requires MagTek's involvement. To set the device lock state without involving MagTek use Command 0xEF04 – Load LTPK Protection Key. The value of the device lock state will revert to the value of **Property 1.2.5.2.1.2 Device Lock State After Reset** after a reset or a power cycle. See **Device Lock Feature** for more information. |

| Description          | This property can be used to get or set what **Property 1.2.5.2.1.1 Device Lock State** will be set to after the device is reset or power cycled. Systems that use the optional device lock feature should set this property to locked, otherwise all someone would need to do to unlock the device would be to power cycle or reset it. The value of the device lock state after reset property is stored in non-volatile memory so changes made to it will persist after the device is reset or power cycled.

| Description          | This property can be used to set the device lock passcode. The value of the device lock passcode is stored in non-volatile memory so changes made to it will persist after the device is reset or power cycled. For security, the host can’t get the value of the device lock passcode from the device. If the host gets this property, the device will always return a length of 0 and no value. Setting this property requires security. Setting it requires the use of **Command 0xD112 - Set Property (Secured)** which requires MagTek's involvement. To set the device lock passcode without involving MagTek use **Command 0xEF07 – Change Device Lock Passcode**. See **Device Lock Feature** for more information. |

| Description          | The host can use this property to acknowledge it has received the **Device Reset Occurred** notification in **Notification 0x1001 - Device Information Update** and to request that the device stop sending it.  Alternatively, because the device automatically sets the value of this property to 0x00 on boot, the host can use this property to detect power cycles or resets using a polling method. To implement this, the host should read the value on a set schedule (for example, every 2 seconds). If the host finds a value of 0x00, a power cycle or reset has occurred, and the host should set the value back to 0x01. From that point until the next power cycle or reset, the value will remain 0x01.  Changes made to this property will not persist after a power cycle or reset. After a power cycle or reset, this property has a value of 0x00 until the host changes it to 0x01. |

| Description              | The host can use this property to enable **notification reasons** defined in **Notification 0x1001 - Device Information Update** in the **User Events** Category. Each bit enables a specific **Reason** by setting that bit to 1. Byte 0 is the first byte, bit 0 is the LSB of each byte.  The device only detects these user events and sends these notifications when it is idle. While processing a command (not idle), such as when processing a transaction with **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction**, the device only sends notifications related to the command it is currently processing.  Notification reasons may consume power when idle. For example, enabling Contactless reasons requires the device to continuously consume some radio frequency power to detect the presence of a contactless card when idle. To conserve power, only enable the notification reasons that are required by the solution design, if any. The readers and their associated notifications will be disabled if the battery charge is 5 percent or lower.  Changes to this property do not take effect until the device is power cycled or reset. |

| Description              | This parameter defines the number of seconds the device waits for the host to take action (by sending **Command 0x1001 - Start Transaction)** after the device sends **Notification 0x1001 - Device Information Update** to report a User Event / Card Swiped event. After this period of time passes, the device erases the buffered card data from memory.  Changes to this property do not take effect until the device is power cycled or reset. |

| Description          | This OID has been deprecated. The OID can be written or read but it will have no effect of the device’s behavior.  The host can use this property to control the maximum charge level for the battery. All charge percentages reported or displayed will use this percentage as 100% charged.  Setting this value to lower than 0x64 (100%) will increase the life of the battery but reduce the run time when running from the battery.  The Maximum Battery Charge Level takes effect immediately after the host changes it.  |

| Description          | The device uses this property to report its firmware Git and build information. Git bash command “git describe --long --dirty --always” is used to return information about each repository “MAIN”, “SDK”, “EXT” and “AMADIS” in the same order followed by the date and time the firmware was built as a null terminated string.  An example of the string returned is “MAIN[PCI-A3-20200929-61-g46efa1a-dirty]_SDK[PCI-A2-NO-LCD-20200930-2-g6b69d7f]_EXT[PCI-A3-20200929-14-g370c7f0]_AMADIS[PCI-A2-NO-LCD-20200930-4-g5957fb6]_[2020-11-17][14:48:03]” where: “MAIN” means the main repository “PCI-A3-20200929” is the last tag found in this repository “61” means there have been 61 commits made since this tag “g46efa1a” means the hash of the latest commit starts with 46efa1a “dirty” means that the repository has uncommitted changes made since the last commit “[2020-11-17][14:48:03]” is the date and time the firmware was built. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to report which tamper configuration its security systems are currently using. Tampers are configured and locked for security the first time a host calls **Command 0xF016 - Activate Device Security (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY)**, and the device determines and sets this property based on the firmware version installed in the device at that time.  This property exists because the host can not determine which tamper configuration the device is currently using by examining the currently installed firmware version; if a host activates the device’s security systems while the device is loaded with firmware that uses an earlier tamper configuration, installing firmware that supports a newer tamper configuration does not change the tamper configuration until an operator resets the device’s security systems.  To reset the device’s security systems and change the tamper configuration, an operator must first reset this property to **Not Configured** by disconnecting all tamper-related power from the device. For example, disconnect USB power, the rechargeable battery, and the coin cell battery, which requires physical access to the inside of the device. This process clears and unlocks the tamper configuration. The host must then call **Command 0xF016 - Activate Device Security (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY)** to activate the device’s security systems again. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to report its operational status.  **Online** is the status the manufacturer populates in this property before shipping, and is the result of the device going through processes that configure its security subsystems and features. In this state, the device is fully functional and can perform transactions.  **Offline** means the device is no longer fully functional and can no longer perform transactions. The device automatically transitions to this state if it detects a problem with security or any of the subsystems it checks. For example, trying to open the device triggers a tamper response, which causes the device to change its operational status to Offline. To retrieve more information about the cause of an Offline status, the host can retrieve **Property 2.3.1.2.1.2 Offline Status Detail**. |

| Description          | The device uses this property to report the status of every subsystem that can cause the device’s operation status to be set to **Offline** in **Property 2.3.1.2.1.1 Device Operational** Status.  The property consists of a sequence of bytes where each bit in each byte represents the status of a subsystem. If a bit is set to one, then there is a problem with the subsystem, otherwise no problem was detected.  Some subsystems provide other properties or commands that can be used to get more information about the subsystem’s status. For example, **Property 2.3.1.1.2.2 Tamper Sensors Activated** and **Property 2.3.1.1.2.3 Tamper Sensor Tampered**. |

###### Object IDs (OIDs) and ITU-T X660

1.  About OIDs

For modular management of device functions, information, and settings, this
standard makes extensive use of Object Identifiers (also known as Object IDs or
OIDs) as defined in **ITU-T X.660 \| ISO/IEC 9834-1**, which can be found by
searching for **X.660** in the publications on
[www.itu.int](http://www.itu.int).

OIDs are identifiers for any generic data element, and are managed by standards
bodies to be globally unique (much like web domains, IP addresses, and Media
Access Control MAC addresses). They are managed by using a tree structure
consisting of **nodes**, where the tree structure is defined and controlled by a
hierarchy of subordinate **Registration Authorities**, each with their authority
delegated by a Registration Authority one level higher in the tree, starting
with the root nodes managed by ITU-T and ISO. The **X.660** standard for OIDs is
harmonized with the data representation standard of **ASN.1** via that
standard’s OBJECT IDENTIFIER and OID-IRI types. Every node is assigned a
**primary integer value** (or primary value for short) which serves to uniquely
identify the node, and may be assigned secondary identifiers (such as strings)
for human readability.

MagTek is the Registration Authority for the OID tree beginning at **{iso(1)
identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) private(4) enterprise(1)
MagTek(15113)}** (using **value notation** of the **ASN.1** OBJECT IDENTIFIER
type). The branch can also be represented in numerical shorthand as
**1.3.6.1.4.1.15113**, which is the **encoding** form of the **ASN.1** OBJECT
IDENTIFIER type.

Per **X.660**, OIDs can be encoded in **constructed** form or **primitive**
form. The primitive form is a sequence of octets (bytes) and is summarized in
section **A.2 Octet Encoding of OIDs**. The constructed form is a TLV data
object and is summarized in section **A.3 TLV Encoding of OIDs**.

In many cases, the MagTek implementation of OID-based message elements allows
the host to specify an optional **Company ID** and **Tree prefix** alongside a
**Relative OID**, where the full OID is a concatenation of the company ID,
followed by the tree prefix, followed by the relative OID. If a message does not
include the optional company ID or tree prefix, company ID is assumed to be the
MagTek arc above, and the tree prefix is assumed to be a reasonable sequence of
additional nodes based on the purpose and scope of the message.

1.  Octet Encoding of OIDs

In addition to human-readable **ASN.1** value notation and encoding forms above,
OIDs can be encoded as binary values (octets) as follows (per **X.660** section
**8.19 Encoding of an object identifier value**):

1.  Start with the numerical form (for example, MagTek’s arc
    **1.3.6.1.4.1.15113** from section **A.1**).
2.  Multiply the primary value of the first node in the OID by 40 decimal (e.g.,
    1\*40=40) and add it to the primary value of the second node. The sum is
    used as the first byte (e.g., 43 decimal = **0x2B**) of the octet form. The
    first two nodes receive this special treatment because their possible value
    ranges are expected to remain very small indefinitely.
3.  The next bytes in the octet encoded form are simply equal to each primary
    value in the OID sequence, unless the primary value is greater than 128
    decimal (0x80). For primary values greater than 0x80, additional encoding
    rules apply that are not necessary to detail here, because for simplicity
    MagTek selects OID primary values that are equal to 0x79 or less (and in
    many cases, 0x30 or less); In addition, TLV encoding places additional
    restrictions on selection of OID, in that if the OID is to be used directly
    as a tag in a TLV data object, it must not be greater than 0x1F (see section
    **3.2.1.1 About TLV Encoding**). The only portion of MagTek’s arc that is
    subject to these additional encoding rules is the primary value **15113** at
    the end, which encodes to **0xF609** hex (per the rules not detailed here,
    see **X.660** for details). The full arc **1.3.6.1.4.1.15113** therefore
    encodes to **0x2B 06 01 04 01 F609**.
1.  TLV Encoding of OIDs

The primary method of encoding OIDs, as specified in **X.660** section **8 Basic
encoding rules**, is BER Tag-Length-Value (TLV) format. A TLV-encoded OID is a
set of nested TLV data objects, where:

-   The **tag** of each TLV data object equals the primary value of the node it
    represents in the OID sequence, encoded according to the BER TLV tag number
    rules; the assigned primary values in this standard are all **private**
    (11nnnnnn), the bottom level value / leaf of any OID arc is encoded as
    **primitive** (nn0nnnnn), and the levels above it are encoded as
    **composed** (nn1nnnnn). This information makes it possible to use the bit
    definitions for **Tag** in section **3.2.1 Tag-Length-Value (TLV) Encoding**
    as a reference to encode each level of the OID as a tag. Generally the
    primary values in this standard are selected to be less than 0x1F, and so do
    not require multi-byte tags.
-   The **length** of each TLV data object, like all TLV data objects, is equal
    to the length of its value.
-   The **value** of each TLV data object is equal to a nested TLV data object
    containing all subsequent nodes in the OID sequence, so TLV-encoded OIDs
    must be built from the bottom up. The primitive value in the bottom node of
    a TLV-encoded OID is the set of actual values contained by that OID (e.g.,
    string, byte[s], and so on), or in the case of requests where the value is
    (by definition) not known to the requester, the length is **0x00**.

For example, the process of TLV encoding the OID in a request to retrieve the
contents of **OID 3.5.7.9** with 9 being a leaf node looks like this (all values
are hexadecimal unless otherwise noted):

1.  First, realize OID 3.5.7.9 is to be interpreted as a nested set of
    containers. Node 3 contains node 5, which contains node 7, which contains
    node 9. Although node 9 presumably contains one or more values, the entity
    making the request for its contents, by definition, does not know the
    contents when composing the request, so in this example, node 9 is treated
    like an “empty bucket.” In the corresponding response, node 9 would include
    its actual contents.
2.  Because TLV is built from the inside out (bottom up), start the encoding
    process with the node at the end which has a primary value equal to 9. Like
    all OIDs in this standard it is **private**, and because it is a leaf node
    at the bottom / end of the OID tree and therefore does not contain any
    further nested TLV data objects, it is **primitive**: 0x09 primary value OR
    0b11000000 private OR 0b00000000 primitive = **C9**. As explained above, in
    this case it is an empty bucket, so its length is **00**. Its TLV encoding
    is **C9 00**.
3.  Up one level to the node with primary value equal to 7, it is also
    **private**, but unlike the previous level it contains a nested TLV data
    object (C9 00 from above) so it is **constructed** instead of primitive:
    0x07 primary value OR 0b11000000 private OR 0b00100000 constructed = **E7**.
    It has contents C9 00 so length is **02**. Its TLV encoding is **E7 02 C9
    00**.
4.  Up one level to the node with primary value 5, it is **private** and
    contains TLV data object E7 02 C9 00 from above, so it is **constructed**:
    0x05 primary value OR 0b11000000 private OR 0b00100000 constructed = **E5**.
    It has contents E7 02 C9 00 so length is **04**. Its TLV encoding is **E5 04
    E7 02 C9 00**.
5.  Up to the root with primary value 3, it is **private** and **constructed**
    so tag is **E3**, value is the TLV data object from above, so length is
    equal to that object’s length **06**. Its encoding is **E3 06 E5 04 E7 02 C9
    00**, which is the final encoding of whole “empty bucket” OID **3.5.7.9**.

###### Design Intent (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY)

The main body of this document describes MMS from a customer’s point of view.
However, when MagTek firmware engineers need to make decisions about extending
or modifying the standard, there are additional factors that are important to
the design that are not important to customers. For example, although the first
release of MMS includes four Message Types, it may become necessary in the
future to add another one, and in that case, the design intent behind the
existing Message Type numbers becomes an important consideration, because
dependent software may make assumptions that rely on certain “invisible rules”
being consistently followed. This section collects the design factors to
consider.

1.  Tag Selection

When constructing a new tag, these are the general parameters for deciding what
it should be:

1.  Message Types

When adding a message type, these are the general parameters for deciding what
it should be:

###### Demo Mode (MAGTEK INTERNAL ONLY FOR NOW)

Demo Mode provides a way to demonstrate the card and barcode readers on the
DynaFlex and DynaProx devices. Once DemoMode is entered, the device must be
rebooted in order exit Demo Mode. The demo can be run on devices that do not
have a LCD display. The LEDs and beeps will indicate the state of the demo.

1.  Preparation for Demo Mode

To use the contactless reader, contactless events must be enabled. Writing
03000000 to OID 1.2.7.1.2.1 will the enable events for the contactless reader.
See [**Property 1.2.7.1.2.1 User Event Notification Controls
Enable**](#property-127121-user-event-notification-controls-enable) for more
information.

The device must be powered using a USB charger to enter Demo Mode. Demo Mode
will not start when the device is powered from a USB host or when running from
the battery.

If an image is to be displayed in place of the prompt, download the image to the
fourth image file (02000003). See [**Command 0xD812 - Start Send File to Device
(Unsecured)**](#command-0xd812---start-send-file-to-device-unsecured) for more
information.

1.  Running the Demo

To run the demo, execute the following steps:

1.  Power the device from a USB charger. The device will boot. Do not remove
    power until you are finished running the demo. Wait for the device to
    display the Welcome screen.
2.  On the back of the device, near the USB port, is a small oval button. Press
    and hold the button until the device beeps exactly five times then release
    the button.
3.  A series of short beeps will sound to indicate that the demo has started. If
    an image has been stored in the fourth image file, the image will be
    displayed. If no image has been saved, the device will prompt for a card. If
    the device has a barcode reader, the prompt will also prompt for a barcode
    and the barcode reader’s light will turn on. The first LED will be green,
    and the rest will be off.
4.  Insert, tap, or swipe a card or scan a barcode.
5.  When a card or barcode is read, the device will sound a specific number of
    beeps, display a results text and light an LED. The following table shows
    the result of each type of read:

Table 1252 - LED Display

| Reader      | Beeps | LED      | Displayed Text                    |
|-------------|-------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Barcode     | 1     | 1st Blue | “MSR Read Successful”             |
| MSR         | 2     | 2nd Blue | “Contactless EMV Read Successful” |
| Contact     | 3     | 3rd Blue | “Contact EMV Read Successful”     |
| Contactless | 4     | 4th Blue | “MSR Read Successful”             |

6.  The results will display for four seconds.
7.  If a card is still in the contact reader or in range of the contactless
    reader, a prompt to remove the card will be displayed and an error beep l
    also sound about once a second until the card is removed.
8.  Return to step 3.
    1.  Exiting the Demo

Unplug the USB cable to shut down the device. After unplugging the USB cable,
WLAN devices will have to be turned off using the button on the back of the

1.  Battery Charge Status

As mentioned in **Appendix G Physical Button (DynaFlex Only)**, there is only
one physical button on DynaFlex devices. Pressing and holding this button until
the device beeps six times then releasing it causes the LEDs on the front of the
device to display the current charge state of the battery. The LEDs will return
to their previous state after three seconds.
