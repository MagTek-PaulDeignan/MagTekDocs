# Command 0x1001 – Start Transaction {#command-0x1001}

The host uses this command to start a payment transaction.

---

## Sequence of Events

For transactions with card readers enabled, the flow is:

1. If user event notifications are enabled via [Property 1.2.7.1.2.1 – User Event Notification Controls Enable](../Properties/#property-1-2-7-1-2-1),  
   the cardholder may present a card before the host calls this command.  
   In that case, the device sends [Notification 0x1001 – Device Information Update](../Notifications/#notification-0x1001),  
   prompting the host to start a transaction.

2. **MSR Only**: If the cardholder swipes before the transaction starts,  
   the device temporarily stores card swipe data for the period defined by  
   [Property 1.2.7.1.2.2 – User Event Notification MSR Data Timeout](../Properties/#property-1-2-7-1-2-2).  

3. The host calls **Start Transaction** (`0x1001`).

4. The device guides the cardholder through interaction (MSR, EMV Contact, Contactless, or MCE).

5. The device sends transaction data and status responses back to the host.

## Error Conditions

| Status Word (SW1SW2) | Description & Context                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **9000**             | **Success** – The command completed successfully. Typically returned after `Start Transaction` or data retrieval when no errors occurred. |
| **6A80**             | **Invalid data** – The command data field is malformed or not acceptable (e.g., CIVV error during card authentication). Returned early in the transaction sequence if input data fails validation. |
| **6985**             | **Conditions not satisfied** – Required conditions are not met (e.g., ICC not present in EMV Contact transaction, or NFC disabled for Contactless). Often seen if the host issues a command too early. |
| **6A82**             | **File/record not found** – The requested TLV object, key, or file reference does not exist. Can occur if the host queries a property or transaction field not supported by the device configuration. |
| **6A83**             | **Authentication method blocked** – Too many failed PIN or authentication attempts. Transaction flow is aborted; the device requires reset or host intervention. |
| **6A84**             | **Not enough memory space** – The device cannot buffer or store additional transaction data. Usually seen if the host sends oversized APDU/TLV structures. |
| **6A88**             | **Referenced data not found** – A dependency object (such as a cryptographic key or certificate) is missing. Often occurs when host references a KSN or key slot that has not been provisioned. |
| **6F00**             | **Unknown error / technical issue** – A generic failure code. Indicates an unexpected device error or internal processing fault. May require device reset and re-issuance of the transaction command. |


*(Exact codes depend on device firmware; this list shows commonly returned errors.)*

## Notes

- **MSR Only**: Temporary storage of swiped card data is controlled by [Property 1.2.7.1.2.2 – User Event Notification MSR Data Timeout](../Properties/#property-1-2-7-1-2-2).  
- **EMV Contact Only**: An Integrated Circuit Card (ICC) must be physically present in the card slot before the transaction can proceed.  
- **Contactless Only**: The device must have the NFC reader module enabled and configured. Without it, contactless transactions cannot be initiated.  
- **MCE Only**: The cardholder must use the device keypad or the host application must provide a user interface to enter account data.  
- **(MagTek Internal Only)** Certain DFDF4D/RAAT TLV combinations are reserved for future use and should not be sent by host applications.
