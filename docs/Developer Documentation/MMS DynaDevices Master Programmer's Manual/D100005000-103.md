# Command 0x1001 – Start Transaction

The host uses this command to start a payment transaction.

---

## Sequence of Events

For transactions with card readers enabled, the flow is:

1. If user event notifications are enabled via [Property 1.2.7.1.2.1 – User Event Notification Controls Enable](../Properties/#property-127121-user-event-notification-controls-enable),  
   the cardholder may present a card before the host calls this command.  
   In that case, the device sends [Notification 0x1001 – Device Information Update](../Notifications/#notification-0x1001-device-information-update),  
   prompting the host to start a transaction.

   - **MSR Only**: If the cardholder swipes before the transaction starts,  
     the device temporarily stores card swipe data for the period defined by  
     [Property 1.2.7.1.2.2 – User Event Notification MSR Data Timeout](../Properties/#property-127122-user-event-notification-msr-data-timeout).

2. The host calls **Start Transaction**.

3. The device guides the cardholder through interaction (MSR, EMV Contact, Contactless, or MCE).

4. The device sends transaction data and status responses.

### Notes

- **(MSR Only)** Temporary storage of swiped card data is controlled by [Property 1.2.7.1.2.2 – User Event Notification MSR Data Timeout](../Properties/#property-127122).  
  This ensures the data is retained long enough for the host to issue a **Start Transaction**.

- **(EMV Contact Only)** An Integrated Circuit Card (ICC) must be physically present in the card slot before the transaction can proceed.

- **(Contactless Only)** The device must have the NFC reader module enabled and configured.  
  Without it, contactless transactions cannot be initiated.

- **(MCE Only)** The cardholder must use the device keypad or the host application must provide a user interface to enter account data.

- **(MagTek Internal Only)** Certain DFDF4D/RAAT TLV combinations are reserved for future use and should not be sent by host applications.
