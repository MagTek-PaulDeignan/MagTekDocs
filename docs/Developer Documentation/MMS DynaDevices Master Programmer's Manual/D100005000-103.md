# Command Group 0x10nn – Transactions

## General Preconditions

*Device Power and Initialization*
- The device must be powered on and in a ready state. If applicable, a Device Ready Notification has been received after reset or power-up.

**Transport Layer Availability*
- The communication interface (USB, BLE, WLAN, Ethernet, or iAP2) must be active and supported by the device variant. Commands that are transport-specific (e.g., BLE GATT-only commands) must be sent over the correct interface.

**Secure Session and Keys**
- If the command requires encrypted communication or key usage (e.g., DUKPT, SRED, or session-based operations), the appropriate keys must be loaded and active. The device must not be in a locked or tampered state.

**Property Configuration**
- Any enabling property required for command execution must already be configured by the host. For example, notification-related commands will only function if Property 1.2.7.1.2.1 – User Event Notification Controls Enable has been set.

**Error Recovery**
- If a previous command resulted in an error state, the host must reset or clear the error before issuing further Transaction commands.

## Command 0x1001 – Start Transaction

This command initiates a payment transaction. In addition to the General Preconditions defined above, the following transaction-specific preconditions apply:

**Buffered Card Data (MSR Only)**
- If the cardholder swiped before the transaction was started, the device temporarily stores the card data for the duration configured by Property 1.2.7.1.2.2 – User Event Notification MSR Data Timeout.

**EMV Kernel State (EMV Contact Only)**
- For EMV transactions, the EMV kernel must be in a reset state before a new transaction begins.

**Manual Card Entry (MCE Only)**
- If Manual Card Entry mode is enabled, the host must configure entry parameters prior to invoking this command.
