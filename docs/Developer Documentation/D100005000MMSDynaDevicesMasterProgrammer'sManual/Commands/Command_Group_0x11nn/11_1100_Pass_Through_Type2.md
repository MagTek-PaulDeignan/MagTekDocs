# 0x1100 — Pass Through Command for NTAG / MIFARE Ultralight (Type 2)

After a Type 2 tag is activated, the host uses this command to issue native **NTAG/Ultralight** operations (e.g., `GET_VERSION`, `READ`, `FAST_READ`, `WRITE`, `AUTHENTICATE`) and receive the tag's response via the device.

---

## Sequence of Events

**Preconditions**
- Contactless reader is active and a Type 2 tag (NTAG/Ultralight) has been activated.
- If read-protection is enabled on the tag (e.g., address `0x00`), host must use the correct key or the device will fail to access protected areas.

**Steps**
1. Construct **0x1100** with the desired native command in TLV `81` and set `82/83` as needed.
2. Send **0x1100** to the device.
3. The device forwards the command to the tag and collects the response.
4. The device returns a response to **0x1100** containing any encrypted/un‑encrypted NFC data container.
5. If `83` indicates more commands are expected, repeat from step 1 until the last command is sent.

**Error/Recovery**
- For failures (`81` in response ≠ success), verify opcode/parameters and any authentication steps; retry as appropriate.

## Notes
- Use `GET_VERSION (0x60)` before feature‑sensitive operations to branch logic by tag type.
- For protected reads, authenticate first to avoid device‑level failures.
