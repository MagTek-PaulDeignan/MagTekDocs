# 0x1101 — Pass Through Command for MIFARE Classic/MINI®/Plus SL1 (Security Level 1), Type 2

After activation of a Type 2 tag in Classic/MINI/Plus SL1 mode, the host uses this command to issue native **MIFARE Classic** operations (e.g., `AUTH`, `READ`, `WRITE`, value operations) and receive the tag's response via the device.

---

## Sequence of Events

**Preconditions**
- Type 2 tag with Classic/MINI/Plus SL1 is activated and in RF field.
- Correct key (A/B) is available for the target sector/block if access‑controlled.

**Steps**
1. Construct **0x1101** with the native command bytes in `81` and set `82/83` to indicate encryption and whether this is the last command.
2. Send **0x1101** to the device.
3. Device forwards the command to the tag and collects the response.
4. Device returns a response with status and the NFC/MIFARE data container.
5. Repeat with additional commands if needed until `83` indicates last command.

**Error/Recovery**
- If authentication fails or the tag returns **NAK/0xFF**, correct the key and retry. For chained operations (e.g., value ops), maintain command order and timing.
