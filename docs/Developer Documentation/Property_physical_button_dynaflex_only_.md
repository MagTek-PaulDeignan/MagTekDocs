Every DynaFlex device features a single physical button. On the DynaFlex
II Go, this button is located on the left side of the device. For all
other models, it is located on the bottom of the device near the USB
port. Pressing and holding this button can activate additional functions
on the device. To active a specific function, press and hold the button
until a specific number of beeps are heard. Table G8.7-48 shows which
functions can be activated. Beep counts that are not listed are not
supported.
