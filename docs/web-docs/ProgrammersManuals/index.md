# MMS and V5 programming specifications

Welcome to the MagTek Developer Documentation portal. This site provides structured technical documentation for developers integrating MagTek's secure payment hardware into their applications and systems.

MagTek devices such as DynaFlex, DynaFlex II, DynaFlex Go, and DynaProx offer robust support for card-present transactions using technologies including MSR, EMV Contact/Contactless, NFC, and Barcode Scanning. These devices communicate using the MagTek Messaging Schema (MMS), a flexible protocol designed for secure and efficient command-based interaction between host applications and payment hardware.

This documentation covers:

* Command Reference Guides for MMS-based device communication

* Device configuration properties organized by function group

* Notification and response message formats

* Connection types, including USB HID, Bluetooth® LE, WLAN, and Ethernet

* Security architecture, including encryption, MACs, KSN, and device locking mechanisms

Use the sidebar to browse device manuals, configuration options, command groups, and other developer resources. Each section includes anchor links, fully rendered tables, and internal references to streamline navigation and improve implementation accuracy.
